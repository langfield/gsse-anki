## If you don't already use Anki

- Read the Anki manual or watch The AnKing's tutorials on YouTube
- Join UNSW Anki Club as a member for access to Essential Anki and other seminars
- It's expected that before commencing properly, you'll have at least the following bare minimum Anki knowledge requirements:
    - Vanilla Anki
        - How to make and edit cards
        - Deck structure and using the browser
        - Optimal intervals and why spaced repetition matters
    - Addons
        - Image Occlusion
        - Hierarchical Tags
        - Cloze Overlapper

## Structuring information in Anki
- We will be using [Supermemo's 20 rules](https://www.notion.so/Summary-of-S20-f7a3c5fda3934e21961d6a71dcaf86e3) to structure our information
    - Sometimes you'll see me writing "S20-compliant" as a way to say that the card fits these principles or has otherwise passed all the quality checks
- Style guide
    - A style guide using examples from Mickey's deck is available here: https://newageoflight.github.io/gsse-anki/style-guide/
    - If you need more references, have a look at [Zanki](https://www.ankipalace.com/step-1-deck) or [WiWa](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/97ssh3/wiwa_deck_for_step_ii_ck_reupload/)
    - The aim is that cards will have a tags and a breadcrumb trail at the top, but you don't necessarily need to type them yourself. The intent is to add these either on export or using the [Clickable Tags](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1739176371) addon.
- Approach
    - Try to use a "ground-up" approach to anatomy if possible i.e. bones → muscles → vasculature and lymphatics → organs → superficial structures
    - Otherwise, synthesise out of the resources
- I've made a forum post about [why we can't just directly copy Hyerim's stuff](https://www.notion.so/Forum-4d013ff04c944974a1db10add0b7180f?p=e6c954501e9347489b244869ea98abef)

## How this project will work
- Right now we are operating like this:
    - **Contributors** are assigned to **Teams** led by **Section leaders**. These teams are responsible for completing a subdeck relating to a particular subtopic of the GSSE e.g. Head and Neck Anatomy.
    - **Section leaders** and **Teams** send final products to the **Auditors** for review, quality control and finalisation.
    - Coordinating the project, setting goals, calling meetings, etc. is done by the **Project Manager**. However, anyone is free to make suggestions or contribute ideas about the coordination/running of the project at any time.
- In the long term, we are aiming to facilitate a Wiki-style contribution model with the aim of allowing simultaneous contribution and auditing, as well as greater team flexibility and allowing contributors to contribute to any section of their choice at any time. However the exact implementation of this concept is up for discussion.
- The Notion acts as a project board for our tasks
- The Discord server and Facebook Group are where project communication should take place
- The Github is where finalised cards will be hosted

## Disciplinary procedures
- **Contributors** who are not contributing will be given a warning. Enough warnings may result in a call for a vote-kick.
- **Section leaders** have the right to deassign anyone from their team if they feel they are not contributing enough.
- **Contributors** who are not contributing enough to the entire project should be notified to the **Project Manager** and subjected to a vote-kick.

## Resources
- IT IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE THAT EVERYONE USES LAST'S 9TH EDITION
- See the [Resources page on the Notion](https://www.notion.so/4806c46fbd5c414fbddb0bdd1190e2cb?v=7a49161c5eb64e689d832205365e1517) for recommended resources.

### Prioritising and handling resources
- In line with S20, start with the simplest. We've currently agreed on the following order:
    - Anatomy
        1. Video lecture resources e.g. Acland's, Instant Anatomy Lectures
        2. If possible, McLast's (just to get an understanding/because it's easier)
        3. Last's and Instant Anatomy (try to combine/reconcile)
    - Physiology
        1. Julie Mundy's slides
        2. Anything closer to BRS Physiology than Ganong's (in terms of style)
        3. Ganong's/West's
    - Pathology
        1. Julie Mundy's slides
        2. Robbins/Pathoma

## Organisation
- Broad project goals and tasks are listed under the [Roadmap](https://www.notion.so/0293564848c24d7bb1224cc7665d8ebd?v=e00f137ac5b74b52a7d417a14e642f03)
- Short term and daily tasks will be listed under the [Task List](https://www.notion.so/c1ca86a78f4641c7931794a5992536f2?v=80471d32cf8f410095f980581752fd52). This includes things like fixing issues and errata.
