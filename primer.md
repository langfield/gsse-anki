## If you don't already use Anki
- Read the Anki manual or watch The AnKing's tutorials on YouTube
- Join UNSW Anki Club as a member for access to Essential Anki and other seminars
- It's expected that before commencing properly, you'll have at least the following bare minimum Anki knowledge requirements:
    - Vanilla Anki
        - How to make and edit cards
        - Deck structure and using the browser
        - Optimal intervals and why spaced repetition matters
    - Addons
        - Image Occlusion
        - Hierarchical Tags
        - Cloze Overlapper

## Structuring information in Anki
- We will be using [Supermemo's 20 rules](https://www.notion.so/Summary-of-S20-f7a3c5fda3934e21961d6a71dcaf86e3) to structure our information
    - Sometimes you'll see me writing "S20-compliant" as a way to say that the card fits these principles or has otherwise passed all the quality checks
- Style guide
    - A style guide using examples from Mickey's deck is available here: https://newageoflight.github.io/gsse-anki/style-guide/
    - If you need more references, have a look at [Zanki](https://www.ankipalace.com/step-1-deck) or [WiWa](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/97ssh3/wiwa_deck_for_step_ii_ck_reupload/)
    - The aim is that cards will have a tags and a breadcrumb trail at the top, but you don't necessarily need to type them yourself. The intent is to add these either on export or using the [Clickable Tags](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1739176371) addon.
- Approach
    - Try to use a "ground-up" approach to anatomy if possible i.e. bones → muscles → vasculature and lymphatics → organs → superficial structures
    - Otherwise, synthesise out of the resources
- I've made a forum post about [why we can't just directly copy Hyerim's stuff](https://www.notion.so/Forum-4d013ff04c944974a1db10add0b7180f?p=e6c954501e9347489b244869ea98abef)

## How this project will work
- Right now we are operating like this:
    - **Contributors** are assigned to **Teams** led by **Section leaders**. These teams are responsible for completing a subdeck relating to a particular subtopic of the GSSE e.g. Head and Neck Anatomy.
    - **Section leaders** and **Teams** send final products to the **Auditors** for review, quality control and finalisation.
    - Coordinating the project, setting goals, calling meetings, etc. is done by the **Project Manager**. However, anyone is free to make suggestions or contribute ideas about the coordination/running of the project at any time.
- In the long term, we are aiming to facilitate a Wiki-style contribution model with the aim of allowing simultaneous contribution and auditing, as well as greater team flexibility and allowing contributors to contribute to any section of their choice at any time. However the exact implementation of this concept is up for discussion.
- The Notion acts as a project board for our tasks
- The Discord server and Facebook Group are where project communication should take place
- The Github is where cards will be hosted during the development process. *Everybody is highly encouraged to learn the basics of Git and Github*.

## Disciplinary procedures
- **Contributors** who are not contributing will be given a warning. Enough warnings may result in a call for a vote-kick.
- **Section leaders** have the right to deassign anyone from their team if they feel they are not contributing enough.
- **Contributors** who are not contributing enough to the entire project should be notified to the **Project Manager** and subjected to a vote-kick. Anyone is free to do the nomination, not just section leaders.

## Resources
- IT IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE THAT EVERYONE USES LAST'S 9TH EDITION
- See the [Resources page on the Notion](https://www.notion.so/4806c46fbd5c414fbddb0bdd1190e2cb?v=7a49161c5eb64e689d832205365e1517) for recommended resources.

### Prioritising and handling resources
- In line with S20, start with the simplest. We've currently agreed on the following order:
    - Anatomy
        1. Last's and Instant Anatomy (try to combine/reconcile). Use the other resources more as understanding guides.
- For other areas, most should already be covered by the USMLE merge-in. It's likely that the two most critical non-anatomy areas (physiology and pathology) will be a superset of the USMLE content so here's their resource order:
    - Physiology
        1. Leon Lai notes, Julie Mundy's slides
        2. Anything closer to BRS Physiology than Ganong's (in terms of style)
        3. Ganong's/West's
    - Pathology
        1. Leon Lai notes, Julie Mundy's slides
        2. Anything closer to Pathoma than Robbins
        3. Robbins
- As for the others, if there's something that's not covered by the USMLE merge-in, let me know and we'll sort it out.

## The absolute basics of using Git, Github and Github Desktop
### Why you shouldn't be scared of Git
Git is most often used in a programming context but I honestly don't see any reason why non-coders shouldn't adopt it. It's a very powerful and useful version control system that allows for easy reconciliation of conflict, plus it's not particularly hard to learn.

### Synchronising and making changes
1. First clone the Github repo in Github Desktop.
2. If you want to check for changes on the central server again, click fetch. To receive the changes, click pull.
3. Whenever you want to make a change to the deck, select the `gsse-anki` folder where the repo is contained and hit "Export" from CrowdAnki.
4. Go to Github Desktop and commit the changes, making sure to include a message describing what changes you have made.
    - The convention with Git is to use the present tense in your commit message. Imagine that people will read it like "this commit (your message)" e.g. "this commit updates the thorax cards"
5. To make sure your changes are synced with the central server, push the changes to server.
