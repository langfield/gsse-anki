## If you don't already use Anki
- Read the Anki manual or watch The AnKing's tutorials on YouTube
- Join UNSW Anki Club as a member for access to Essential Anki and other seminars
- It's expected that before commencing properly, you'll have at least the following bare minimum Anki knowledge requirements:
    - Vanilla Anki
        - How to make and edit cards
        - Deck structure and using the browser
        - Optimal intervals and why spaced repetition matters
    - Addons
        - Image Occlusion
        - Hierarchical Tags
        - Cloze Overlapper

## Structuring information in Anki
- We will be using [Supermemo's 20 rules](https://www.notion.so/Summary-of-S20-f7a3c5fda3934e21961d6a71dcaf86e3) to structure our information
    - Sometimes you'll see me writing "S20-compliant" as a way to say that the card fits these principles or has otherwise passed all the quality checks
- Style guide
    - A style guide using examples from Mickey's deck is available here: https://newageoflight.github.io/gsse-anki/style-guide/
    - If you need more references, have a look at [Zanki](https://www.ankipalace.com/step-1-deck) or [WiWa](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/97ssh3/wiwa_deck_for_step_ii_ck_reupload/)
    - The aim is that cards will have a tags and a breadcrumb trail at the top, but you don't necessarily need to type them yourself. The intent is to add these either on export or using the [Clickable Tags](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1739176371) addon.
- Approach
    - Try to use a "ground-up" approach to anatomy if possible i.e. bones → muscles → vasculature and lymphatics → organs → superficial structures
    - Otherwise, synthesise out of the resources
- Begin with the end-user in mind
    - Everyone has their own preferences and ideas about how they personally like to style and use Anki. However, since this is a deck that is designed to be shared in the public good, it is necessary for us to think more about our end-users than ourselves when making the cards.
    - To that end, make sure you observe these guidelines:
        - Read and fully internalise all of S20's rules
        - Assume the people using our deck may not necessarily be very smart or very keen on surgery - so keep the cards and explanations as simple and un-confusing as possible
        - Try auditing the cards you make yourself first before sending them to me. Ask yourself: do you enjoy using them? Are they easy to learn from? How easily do they stick? If *you're* not happy with them, don't expect that someone else will be!

## How this project will work
- Right now we are operating like this:
    - **Contributors** are assigned to **Teams** led by **Section leaders**. These teams are responsible for completing a subdeck relating to a particular subtopic of the GSSE e.g. Head and Neck Anatomy.
    - **Section leaders** and **Teams** send final products to the **Auditors** for review, quality control and finalisation.
    - Coordinating the project, setting goals, calling meetings, etc. is done by the **Project Manager**. However, anyone is free to make suggestions or contribute ideas about the coordination/running of the project at any time.
- In the long term, we are aiming to facilitate a Wiki-style contribution model with the aim of allowing simultaneous contribution and auditing, as well as greater team flexibility and allowing contributors to contribute to any section of their choice at any time. However the exact implementation of this concept is up for discussion.
- The Notion acts as a project board for our tasks and will contain all the TODOs.
- The Discord server and Facebook Group are where project communication should take place
- The Github is where cards will be hosted during the development process. *Everybody is highly encouraged to learn the basics of Git and Github*.
- For more information on collaboration workflows, see the [protocols](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Disciplinary procedures
- **Contributors** who are not contributing will be given a warning. Enough warnings may result in a call for a vote-kick.
- **Section leaders** have the right to deassign anyone from their team if they feel they are not contributing enough.
- **Contributors** who are not contributing enough to the entire project should be notified to the **Project Manager** and subjected to a vote-kick. Anyone is free to do the nomination, not just section leaders.

## Resources
- IT IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE THAT EVERYONE USES LAST'S 9TH EDITION
- See the [Resources page on the Notion](https://www.notion.so/4806c46fbd5c414fbddb0bdd1190e2cb?v=7a49161c5eb64e689d832205365e1517) for recommended resources.

### Prioritising and handling resources
- Regarding potential content coverage:
    - Anatomy: focus on the syllabus' stated foci. Last's remains the preferred text for GSSE Anatomy.
    - Physiology/Pathology/everything else: just about everything on USMLE Step 1 is fair game, including the more out-there stuff like biochem/molecular biology/pharmacology.
    - Relation to BPT and Radiology exams: it is safe to assume that all BPT content is coverable, as is the anatomy syllabus in Radiology exams.
- In line with S20:
    - For your own personal understanding, start with the simplest/easiest resources.
    - For making the cards, prefer the recommended texts.
    - Do not be limited to the recommended texts if you need to add images or explanations to the cards. Though they may be prescribed, it doesn't mean that they're always the best at explaining their own content. Freely use anything from anywhere you can find, as long as it is clear and simple to understand.
- We've currently agreed on the following order:
    - Anatomy
        1. Last's and Instant Anatomy (try to combine/reconcile). Use the other resources more as understanding guides.
- For other areas, most should already be covered by the USMLE merge-in. It's likely that the two most critical non-anatomy areas (physiology and pathology) will be a superset of the USMLE content so here's their resource order. Leon Lai and Julie Mundy's resources just happen to be more high yield as well:
    - Physiology
        1. Leon Lai notes, Julie Mundy's slides
        2. Ganong's/West's (however, for personal understanding you should try to find something closer to [BRS Physiology](https://www.amazon.com.au/Brs-Physiology-Linda-S-Costanzo/dp/1496367618) in style)
    - Pathology
        1. Leon Lai notes, Julie Mundy's slides
        2. Robbins and Cotran's Pathologic Basis of Disease (however, for personal understanding you should try to find something more like [Pathoma](https://www.pathoma.com/))
- As for the others, if there's something that's not covered by the USMLE merge-in, let me know and we'll sort it out.

## Organisation
- Broad project goals and tasks are listed under the [Roadmap](https://www.notion.so/0293564848c24d7bb1224cc7665d8ebd?v=e00f137ac5b74b52a7d417a14e642f03)
- Short term and daily tasks will be listed under the [Task List](https://www.notion.so/c1ca86a78f4641c7931794a5992536f2?v=80471d32cf8f410095f980581752fd52). This includes things like fixing issues and errata.
