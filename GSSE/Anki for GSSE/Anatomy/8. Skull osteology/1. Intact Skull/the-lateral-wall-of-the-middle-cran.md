              The lateral wall of the middle cranial fossa is made
              by the squamous part of the temporal bone. At its
              junction with the floor (petrous bone), it is
              perforated by the {{c1::meningeal}} branch of the
              {{c3::mandibular}} nerve on its way to the
              {{c2::mastoid antrum}} and air cells.
