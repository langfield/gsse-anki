      In front of the tuberculum sellae and carotid grooves the
      fibrous dura mater floors the {{c1::prechiasmatic groove}}
      and is <i>projected into the optic canals around the optic
      nerves</i> as they pass into the orbits. The optic chiasma
      lies at a {{c2::higher}} level well behind the groove.
