        In the temporal fossa, the greater wing of the sphenoid
        articulates behind with the squamous temporal to form a
        [[oc1::convexity]] which is the lateral wall of the middle
        cranial fossa, and it articulates in front with the
        zygomatic bone to form a deep [[oc2::concavity]] which is
        the lateral wall of the orbit.
