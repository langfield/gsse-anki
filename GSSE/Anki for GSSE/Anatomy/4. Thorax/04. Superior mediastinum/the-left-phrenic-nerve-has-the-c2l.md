      The left phrenic nerve has the {{c2::left common carotid}}
      artery and {{c2::left subclavian}} artery that arise from the
      arch of the aorta to its medial side. It crosses the arch
      lateral ({{c5::superficial::superficial/deep}}) to the
      {{c3::left superior intercostal}} vein and in front of the
      {{c4::vagus}} nerve, and then runs laterally down the
      pericardium over the {{c1::left ventricle::part of heart}}
      towards the apex of the heart.
