### Text
The arch of the aorta lies in the plane of the {{c1::sternal angle}}, i.e. the arch of the aorta lies wholly in the {{c5::superior}} mediastinum, behind the manubrium. It does not pass from right to left, but from in front at the manubrium backwards to the body of {{c2::T4}} vertebra. It arches over the beginning of the {{c3::left bronchus}} and the {{c4::bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk }}
