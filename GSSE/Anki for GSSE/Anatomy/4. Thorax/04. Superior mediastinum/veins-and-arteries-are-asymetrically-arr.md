### Text
Veins and arteries are asymetrically arranged; the veins are on the
{{c1::right}} side and the arteries are on the {{c1::left}} side.
<div>
  <div>
    On the right side structures are in contact with veins, on the
    left side with arteries. Veins expand {{c2::enormously}}, large
    arteries {{c2::not at all}}, during increased blood flow. Thus
    there is much 'dead space' on the {{c3::right}}, none on the
    {{c3::left}}, and it is into this space that tumours of the
    mediastinum or liquid collections tend to project.
