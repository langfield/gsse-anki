      The mucous membrane of the trachea is supplied by afferent
      (including pain) fibres from the {{c1::vagi}} and
      {{c2::recurrent laryngeal}} nerves, which also provide
      parasympathetic fibres of uncertain function. The smooth
      muscle and blood vessels are supplied by the
      {{c3::sympathetic fibres}} from {{c4::upper}} ganglia of the
      sympathetic trunks.
