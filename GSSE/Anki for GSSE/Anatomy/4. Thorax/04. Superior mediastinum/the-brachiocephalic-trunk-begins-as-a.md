        The brachiocephalic trunk begins as a midline branch from
        the arch and immediately diverges to the {{c1::right}}
        beside the trachea. The two other branches of the arch, the
        left common carotid and left subclavian arteries, pass
        upwards on the {{c2::left side}} of the trachea, so that
        the thoracic part of the trachea is clasped by an
        asymmetrical V

  Clinical significance: These great arteries keep the left vagus
  nerve and apex of the left lung away from contact with the
  trachea. On the right side there is no structure to separate the
  trachea from the right vagus and apex of the right lung. Tracheal
  breath sounds are thus conducted, by direct contact, to the right
  apex. On the left side the great arteries intervene, and breath
  sounds are here more subdued, being conducted only along the
  bronchial tree.
