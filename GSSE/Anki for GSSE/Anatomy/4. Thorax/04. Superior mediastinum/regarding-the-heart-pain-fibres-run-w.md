      Regarding the heart, pain fibres run with {{c1::sympathetic}}
      nerves, reaching any of the three cervical and upper two or
      three thoracic sympathetic ganglia, but most go to the
      {{c2::inferior cervical}} and {{c2::first thoracic}} ganglia.
      The pain fibres pursue the usual pathway to the central
      nervous system, passing through the sympathetic ganglia to
      the {{c4::spinal}} nerves via {{c3::white}} rami
      communicantes; their cell bodies are in the {{c4::posterior
      root ganglia}}.

### Extra
The connexion with cervical and thoracic spinal nerves presumably
explains the referral of cardiac pain to the arm, chest or neck.
Myocardial infarction may destroy afferent fibres, including those
subserving pain. <img src=
