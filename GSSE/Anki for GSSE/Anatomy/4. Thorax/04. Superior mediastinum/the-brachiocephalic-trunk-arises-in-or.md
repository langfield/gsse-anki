      The brachiocephalic trunk arises in or a little to the left
      of the midline of the body. It slopes upwards across the
      trachea to the back of the {{c1::right sternoclavicular}}
      joint, where it divides into the {{c2::right common carotid}}
      and {{c2::right subclavian}} arteries. It has no branches
      apart from the rare {{c3::thyroidea ima}} artery, which may
      arise from it or directly from the arch of the aorta
