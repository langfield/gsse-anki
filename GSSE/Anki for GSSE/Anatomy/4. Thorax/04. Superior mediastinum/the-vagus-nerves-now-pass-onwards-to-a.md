      The vagus nerves now pass onwards to achieve their object of
      reaching the midline by entering into the oesophageal
      plexuses on the surfaces of the lower oesophagus. In the
      plexuses they become {{c1::mixed}}, and the right and left
      {{c2::vagal trunks}}, as they leave the plexuses, <u>contain
      fibres from</u> {{c3::<u>each</u>::which<u>}} vagus.</u>
