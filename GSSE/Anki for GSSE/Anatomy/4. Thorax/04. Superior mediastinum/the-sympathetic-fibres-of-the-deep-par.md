      The sympathetic fibres of the deep part of cardiac plexus are
      {{c5::post}}ganglionic from cell bodies in the
      {{c1::cervical}} and {{c1::upper thoracic}} ganglia, and the
      <i>preganglionic</i> cells are in the lateral horn of the
      {{c3::upper five or six thoracic}} segments of the cord. The
      vagal fibres are {{c5::pre}}ganglionic from cell bodies in
      the {{c4::dorsal motor}} nucleus of the vagus but some are
      apparently intermingled with cells of the {{c2::nucleus
      ambiguus}}.
