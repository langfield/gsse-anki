### Remarks
From the above it can be seen that the bronchi and segments of the two lungs are very similar. Both lower lobes have five segmental bronchi and segments, the only difference being that on the left the medial basal segment (7) is small because the pericardial excavation suppresses this part of the lung and its bronchus usually arises by a common stem with the anterior basal bronchus (8), thus sometimes giving rise to the erroneous impression that it is absent. The upper lobe of the right lung has three segments and the middle lobe two, and each has its own bronchus. The upper lobe of the left lung has five segments, the two lowest (lingular) corresponding to the two of the middle lobe of the right lung, and it is the rule for the uppermost two to be supplied by bronchi that have a common apicoposterior stem. Note that the lingular part of the left upper lobe has segments called superior and inferior, whereas in the middle lobe of the right lung the adjectives are lateral and medial; otherwise the names on the two sides are identical.
