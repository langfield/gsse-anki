### Text
When {{c1::cartilage}} disappears (at a diameter of about 1 mm) {{c1::bronchi}} become {{c2::bronchioles}}.

### Extra
There can be as many as 27 generations of divisions beyond the main
bronchi; the first 19 are conducting airways, as far as terminal
bronchioles, with no gaseous exchange, but often there are no more
than five or six divisions before the terminal bronchioles are
reached <img src=
