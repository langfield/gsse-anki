### Extra
<p id="9125f96b-6843-4fee-80af-ca05841a089b" class="">Two other
facts about the branching of the bronchi should be emphasized. On
the right the upper lobe bronchus arises high up on the side of the
main bronchus outside the hilum, and on both sides the apical
segment of the lower lobe is supplied by a bronchus (6) which is
the highest to arise from the posterior surface of the bronchial
tree, so that when lying on the back it is the highest bronchus
into which fluid can gravitate.
