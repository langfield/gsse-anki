### Text
<div class="toggle">
  The left {{c1::medial basal}} bronchopulmonary segment is small
  because the {{c2::pericardial excavation/impression}} suppresses
  this part of the lung

### Extra
<p id="7919bb39-0874-4e44-9d0d-e5f7ae52fbca" class="">Last's: "Both
lower lobes have five segmental bronchi and segments, the only
difference being that on the left the medial basal segment (7) is
small because the pericardial excavation suppresses this part of
the lung and its bronchus usually arises by a common stem with the
anterior basal bronchus (8), thus sometimes giving rise to the
erroneous impression that it is absent."
