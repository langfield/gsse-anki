      The afferent fibres of the vagus nerve is in charge of the
      {{c1::cough}} reflex, important for clearing {{c2::excess
      secretions and inhaled substances}} from the tracheobronchial
      tree; the receptors are
      {{c3::unmyelinated::myelinated/unmyelinated}} endings in the
      epithelium.

        The vagi also provide the pathway for the response to
        bronchial stimulation by a catheter passed down the trachea
        (one of the tests for brainstem death). Included among the
        afferent fibres are those subserving pain.
