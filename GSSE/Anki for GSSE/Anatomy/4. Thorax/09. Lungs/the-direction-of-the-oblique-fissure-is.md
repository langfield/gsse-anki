### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  The direction of the oblique fissure is functionally significant
  as it aids with making lung expansion more {{c1::uniform}}
</div>

### Extra
<p id="b07a1f4a-004a-4ee5-a796-84d659af51b6" class="">While the
general elasticity of the lung helps expansion throughout, the fact
that the oblique fissure is diagonal means that the lower parts of
the upper lobe (that are closer to the diaphragm) will have more
room to expand. The higher segments (given that they share the same
substance) will also expand more as a result of the expansion of
the lower segments.
<p id="b7575519-09f5-418e-96db-b82089e9a510" class="">Had the lung
been divided into upper and lower lobes by a horizontal fissure,
this would not be the case.
