### Text
<div class="toggle">
  Movements of the chest wall and diaphragm have more range towards
  the {{c1::base::base/apex}} of the lung
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  From a physiological perspective this should also intuitively
  make sense. Air rises → more of a negative pressure gradient at
  the bottom (∵ less air) → greater room to expand/ventilate (and
  perfuse, but changes at different rates)
