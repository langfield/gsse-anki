### Text
The bronchioles just proximal to respiratory bronchioles are rather confusingly called {{c1::terminal}} bronchioles, but they are not the 'end of the line' as far as tubule division is concerned; they are the most peripheral bronchioles that do not bear any {{c2::alveoli}}.

### Extra
There can be as many as 27 generations of divisions beyond the main
bronchi; the first 19 are conducting airways, as far as terminal
bronchioles, with no gaseous exchange, but often there are no more
than five or six divisions before the terminal bronchioles are
reached<img src=
