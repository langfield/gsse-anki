### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  The so-called "groove for the subclavian artery" on the first rib
  lodges the {{c1::lower trunk of the brachial plexus::nerve
  structure}}
</div>

### Extra
<p id="836a1723-e56e-483e-9c7f-3b2fd7778656" class="">The fibres in
contact with the rib are all T1, and the C8 fibres lie above them,
not yet intermingled.
<p id="9fa1265b-3a12-40bb-bdb8-82154087bc0d" class="">The
subclavian artery has its upward convexity lying more transversely.
The artery does not lie in the groove, and it touches only the
outer border of the rib.
