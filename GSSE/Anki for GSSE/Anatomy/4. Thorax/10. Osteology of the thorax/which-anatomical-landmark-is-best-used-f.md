<div class='toggle'>
  Which anatomical landmark is best used for counting ribs?
  {{c1::2nd costal cartilage}}
</div>

### Extra
<p id="7920db50-a892-440a-9a13-c7c33765b5fc" class="">In the living
the sternal angle is visible and palpable. The second costal
cartilage can be easily felt at either side of the angle; the ribs
must be counted down from here as the only certain guide to their
numerical identification.
