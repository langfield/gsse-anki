### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  The upper {{c1::six}} ribs are relatively flat compared to the
  {{c2::7th-9th}} ribs
</div>

### Extra
<p id="5af4658c-aacf-4043-8bb8-13c00043cf60" class="">The upper six
lie reasonably flat, but the seventh to ninth show a degree of
torsion at their angles that lifts the posterior end of each in a
slope of 30Â° from the table. The tenth, eleventh and twelfth lie
flat.
