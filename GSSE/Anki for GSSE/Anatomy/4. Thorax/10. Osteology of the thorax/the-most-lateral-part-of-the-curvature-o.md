### Extra
<p id="73fcdd4c-e08c-4aa8-8f41-4671f2a10fae" class="">The most
lateral part of the curve shows a characteristic 'bump' â€” a rough
tuberosity on the outer surface of the shaft, which in some bones
resembles the callus of an old fracture. This is for the second and
part of the first digitation of serratus anterior.
