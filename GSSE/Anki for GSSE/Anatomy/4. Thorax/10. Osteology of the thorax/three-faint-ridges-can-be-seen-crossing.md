### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  Three faint ridges can be seen crossing the anterior surface of
  the sternal body between the facets for the {{c1::third, fourth
  and fifth::3}} costal cartilages - these mark the fusion lines of
  adjacent {{c2::sternebrae}}.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="ff2956dc-bae5-49a1-90b6-5955fb3164dd" class="">"Sternebrae"
are the embryonic units of the sternum (intervened by cartilage)
that eventually get fused - in the same sense that "vertebrae" are
the units of the spine. In some other animals (e.g. dogs) they may
not be fused.
