### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  The outer border of the first rib is blunt between the
  1️⃣{{c1::tubercle}} and 1️⃣{{c2::subclavian groove}}.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="32d3f21c-0c2c-42eb-a939-3c2a2e44d77b" class="">Some
undulations in the shaft often produce broad grooves that can be
mistaken for the subclavian grooves on the upper surface; if the
surfaces are reversed the rib will be allotted to the opposite
side. This mistake can be avoided by remembering the slope of the
neck already studied.
