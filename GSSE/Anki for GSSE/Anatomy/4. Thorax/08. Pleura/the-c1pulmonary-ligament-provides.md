### Text
The {{c1::pulmonary ligament}} provides dead space to allow for expansion of vessels in the lung root

### Extra
It provides 'dead space' into which the lung root descends with descent of the diaphragm, and, more importantly, allows for expansion of vessels in the lung root, especially the inferior pul monary vein, which is always the lowest structure in the root. Large veins always have 'dead space' near them (e.g. to the right of the superior vena cava, and in the femoral canal alongside the femoral vein).
