### Text
The {{c1::visceral}} pleura clothes the surface of the lung

### Extra
From its mediastinal layer a cuff of membrane is projected around the lung root and passes on to invest the surface of the lung. This is the visceral layer of the pleura; it extends into the depths of the interlobar clefts.
