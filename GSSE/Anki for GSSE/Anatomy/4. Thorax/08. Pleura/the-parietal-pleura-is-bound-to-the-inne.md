### Text
The parietal pleura is bound to the inner aspect of the chest wall and transversus thoracis muscles by a layer of loose areolar tissue known as the {{c1::endothoracic fascia}}.

### Extra
Almost unworthy of anatomical description, being nowhere membranous, and consisting merely of the fibrous tissue that attaches the pleura to the chest wall.
No analogous binding tissue on fibrous pericardium, but a similar arrangement does exist on the diaphragm.
