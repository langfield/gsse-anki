### Text
The {{c1::parietal}} pleura lines the thoracic wall and thoracic surface of the diaphragm

### Extra
The parietal layer of the pleura lines the thoracic wall (rib cage), to which it is attached by areolar tissue named the endothoracic fascia. It covers the thoracic surface of the diaphragm, from which it ascends over the pericardium to cover the mediastinum and to cling to the suprapleural membrane at the thoracic inlet. This is one continuous sheet.
