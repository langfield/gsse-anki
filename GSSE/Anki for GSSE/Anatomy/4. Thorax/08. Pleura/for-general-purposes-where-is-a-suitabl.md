### Text
For general purposes, where is a suitable location to perform a needle thoracocentesis or chest drain insertion?

{{c1::4th intercostal space, midaxillary line}}

### Extra
The choice of space may be determined by the localization of fluid, e.g. a 
walled-off abscess, but for general purposes the fourth space in or just in 
front of the midaxillary line is often chosen. A needle, trocar and cannula or 
drainage tube inserted here is not near any major structure and is high enough 
to avoid the dome of the diaphragm.

Different texts will have differing opinions on placement of tubes for different applications or even the same ones. This is just what Last's says.
