      In thoracic respiration, the movements of the abdominal wall
      are {{c1::purely passive}}. If the ribs are elevated the
      diaphragm is elevated with the up-going costal margin and the
      abdominal wall is sucked in. With descent of the costal
      margin the abdominal wall moves forwards again.
