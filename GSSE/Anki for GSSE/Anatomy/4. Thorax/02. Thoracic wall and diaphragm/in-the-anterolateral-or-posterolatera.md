        In the anterolateral or posterolateral thoracotomy, care
        must be taken to avoid damage to neurovascular bundle
        {{c1::below}} the rib (usually {{c3::5th or 6th}} rib). The
        nerve to {{c2::serratus anterior}} may have to be
        sacrificed to gain necessary exposure.

### Extra
The periosteum can be stripped off the upper half of the front and
back of the rib (so keeping away from the intercostal nerve and
vessels which run immediately below a rib) and then the periosteal
bed of the rib can then be incised to enter the pleural cavity.

  The left phrenic nerve has the left common carotid and left
  subclavian arteries that arise from the arch of the aorta to its
  medial side. It crosses the arch lateral to the superior
  intercostal vein and in front of the vagus nerve, and then runs
  laterally down the pericardium over the left ventricle towards
  the apex of the heart.‚Äù p261
