        At the back of the intercostal space the intercostal nerve
        crosses {{c1::behind}} the artery; at the front of the
        space the nerve crosses {{c1::in front}} of the internal
        thoracic artery. Between these points the nerve is confined
        in the neurovascular plane {{c2::below::above/below}} the
        artery.

### Extra
In its course around the body wall the main nerve <b>lies in a
wider circle</b> that embraces the narrower circle of the
intercostal vessels; where the nerve crosses the artery it will
<b>always be nearer the skin</b> <img src=
