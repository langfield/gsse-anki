        During inspiration, the {{c1::anteroposterior}} diameter
        increases because the body of the sternum moves forward as
        the ribs are raised, and the sternal movement is
        facilitated by the hinge movement (up to about {{c3::7}}Â°)
        at the {{c2::manubriosternal}} joint

### Extra
<div>
  If the manubriosternal joint becomes ankylosed, thoracic
  expansion is virtually lost (as in emphysema) and only
  diaphragmatic respiration is possible.
