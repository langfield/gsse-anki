### Text
The manubriosternal joint is a {{c1::secondary cartilaginous joint
or symphysis}} joint. The surfaces are covered by
{{c2::<b>hyaline</b>}} cartilage and there is an intervening disc
of {{c3::fibrocartilage}} which often becomes ossified in later
life, but without fusion of the bones so that for respiratory
purposes the joint is <b>mobile</b>.

### Extra

      If this joint becomes ankylosed, thoracic expansion is
      virtually lost (as in emphysema) and only diaphragmatic
      respiration is possible.
