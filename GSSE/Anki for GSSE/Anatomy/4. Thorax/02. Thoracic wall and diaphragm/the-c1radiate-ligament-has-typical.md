### Text
The {{c1::radiate}} ligament has typically {{c1::3::number}} bands and it attaches the capsule of the synovium of the head of the rib with vertebrae

### Extra
The central band runs horizontally, deep to the anterior
longitudinal ligament and across the intervertebral disc with which
it blends, to join with fibres from the other side. This
arrangement, known as the <b>hypochordal bow,</b> is of
morphological interest since it explains the formation of the
anterior arch of the atlas <img src=

  The upper band passes across the joint to the body of the
  vertebra above, and the lower band to the vertebra below. The
  central band runs horizontally, deep to the anterior longitudinal
  ligament and across the intervertebral disc with which it blends.

  The radiate ligament has only 2 bands in the first rib and last 2
  ribs as they articulate with their own vertebra
