    <div>
      The first sternocostal joint is exceptional in that the first
      costal cartilage articulates with the manubrium by a
      {{c1::primary cartilaginous}} joint. This is a joint where
      {{c3::bone}} and {{c2::hyaline}} cartilage meet.

### Extra
<div>
  <div>
    A primary cartilaginous joint is one where bone and hyaline
    cartilage meet. The cartilage (<b>hyaline</b> cartilage) is
    short and thick and capable of very little distortion. Thus the
    manubrium and the first ribs are fixed to each other and move
    together as one. This fixation is necessary to give stability
    to the clavicle and so to the pectoral girdle and upper limb
