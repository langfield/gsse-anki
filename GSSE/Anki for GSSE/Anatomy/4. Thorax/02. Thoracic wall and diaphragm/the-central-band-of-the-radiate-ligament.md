### Text
The central band of the radiate ligament runs horizontally, deep to
the {{c1::anterior longitudinal}} ligament and across the
intervertebral disc with which it blends, to join with fibres from
the {{c2::other side}}. This arrangement, known as the
{{c3::<b><u>hypochordal bow</u></b>}}<b>,</b> is of morphological
interest since it explains the formation of the {{c4::anterior arch
of the atlas}}.
