### Text
The oesophageal opening is usually an inch to the {{c1::left}} of the midline, behind the {{c2::seventh left}} costal cartilage. It lies in the fibres of the {{c1::left}} crus, but a sling of fibres from the {{c1::right}} crus passes on the abdominal surface of these to loop around it

### Extra
The oesophagus may be in the midline in its developmental position.
