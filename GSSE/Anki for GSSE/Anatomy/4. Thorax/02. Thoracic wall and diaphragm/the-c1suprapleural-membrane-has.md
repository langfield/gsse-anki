        The {{c1::suprapleural membrane}} has the cervical dome of
        the pleura attached to its under surface, and when traced
        medially it is found to thin out and disappear into the
        {{c3::mediastinal pleura}}. It is flat and lies in the
        oblique plane of the {{c2::thoracic inlet}}, projecting
        scarcely at all into the root of the neck.
