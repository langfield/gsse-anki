    <div>
      In purely diaphragmatic breathing, where the ribs are
      motionless, respiration is achieved by alternating between
      contraction of the diaphragm and the anterior abdominal wall
      known as {{c3::abdominal}} respiration
    </div>
    <div>
      Descent of the diaphragm is accompanied by {{c1::passive
      relaxation}} of the relaxed abdominal wall. Ascent of the
      diaphragm is accompanied by {{c2::active contraction}} of the
      abdominal wall
