      At the back, the upper two intercostal spaces are supplied by
      the {{c1::superior intercostal}} artery. This is the
      {{c4::descending::ascending/descending}} branch of the
      {{c6::costocervical trunk}}, which comes off from the
      {{c3::second}} part of the subclavian artery {{c5::behind::in
      front of/behind}} {{c2::scalenus anterior}}.

        <div>Superior intercostal artery enters the thorax by
        passing across the front of the neck of the first rib; here
        it has the sympathetic trunk on its medial side, while the
        first thoracic nerve passes laterally across the first rib
        to join the brachial plexus. <img src=
