        There are also neurons in the {{c1::pons}} which can modify
        the activity of the medullary centres; these include the
        {{c2::pneumotaxic}} centre (situated near the superior
        cerebellar peduncle), which is believed to control the
        changeover from inspiration to expiration, and an
        ill-defined {{c3::apneustic}} centre which is also
        concerned with the duration of these respiratory phases.
