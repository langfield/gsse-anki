### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  All of the smooth walled portion of the left atrium is derived by
  incorporation of the embryonic {{c1::pulmonary veins}} into the
  atrial cavity
</div>

### Extra
<p id="2d4349e9-d1ea-46f5-9a52-01b21ac8b250" class="">In the
embryo, two veins from each lung unite to form the left and right
pulmonary veins, which open as a common pulmonary vein into the
left auricle. This eventually dilates and gets incorporated into
the atrial wall (so in this respect, it can be thought of similarly
to the union of the IVC/SVC with RA)
