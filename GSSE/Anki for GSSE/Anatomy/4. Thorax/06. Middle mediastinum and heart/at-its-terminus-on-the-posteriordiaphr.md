### Text
<div class="toggle">
  At its terminus (on the posterior/diaphragmatic surface), the
  right coronary artery anastomoses with the {{c1::circumflex}}
  branch of the left coronary artery as several other small
  terminal arterioles on the lower part of the {{c2::left atrium}}
</div>

### Extra
<p id="0b223905-fedb-49fb-8378-b6f41134a20f" class="">Last's has
yet another opinion on this: the posterior should be called the
inferior, but this isn't the name in clinical use.
<p id="0b223905-fedb-49fb-8378-b6f41134a20f" class="">Instant seems
to think that the PDA and LCX anastomose but strictly speaking this
is wrong; the PDA and LAD anastomose.
