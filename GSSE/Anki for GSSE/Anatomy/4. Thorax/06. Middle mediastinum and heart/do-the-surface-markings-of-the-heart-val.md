### Text
Do the surface markings of the heart valves correspond to their
auscultation sites?
<div>
  {{c1::No}}
</div>

### Extra
Knowledge of the surface markings of the heart valves has little
application in auscultation of the heart. The normal heart sounds
are produced by closure of heart valves, and the opening snap of
the mitral valve may also be audible, but these sounds are by no
means heard best directly over the valves concerned. <b>They are
heard best where the blood-containing chambers lie nearest to the
chest wall.</b>
