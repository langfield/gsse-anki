### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  Oxygenated blood from a cardiopulmonary bypass machine is
  delivered via cannula into the {{c1::aortic arch}}, proximal to
  the branching of the {{c1::brachiocephalic trunk}}
</div>

### Extra
<p id="4b0713b9-00ce-416a-9986-f982d1a09f72" class="">Some of this
blood will pass downwards into the ascending aorta and so perfuse
the coronary vessels whose openings are just above the aortic
valves (kept closed by the pressure of the incoming blood).
