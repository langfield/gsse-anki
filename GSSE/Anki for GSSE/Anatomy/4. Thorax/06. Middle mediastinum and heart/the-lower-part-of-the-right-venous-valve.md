### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  The lower part of the right venous valve (of the sinus venosus)
  becomes the {{c1::valve of the inferior vena cava}} and the
  {{c1::valve of the coronary sinus}}
</div>

### Extra
<p id="9a068a07-7641-4e5a-898e-7a86d2671861" class="">These two
veins have come to open into the right atrium because the part of
the sinus venosus into which they originally opened (the right
horn) has become incorporated into the wall of the atrium, forming
its smooth part; the rough part with the pectinate muscles (which
includes the auricle) represents the original atrium.
