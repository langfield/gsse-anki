### Remarks
Fig. 4.18 Development of the sinuses of the serous pericardium.
<div>
  A The simple heart tube suspended in the fibrous pericardium by
  the serous dorsal mesocardium (M), with the arterial and venous
  ends indicated (Art. and Ven.).
</div>
<div>
  B Ventral view after removal of the heart tube. The left figure
  shows the dorsal mesocardium still present; in the right figure
  it has been absorbed, so giving rise to the space called the
  transverse sinus (TS). Each end of the heart tube remains
  surrounded by a single sleeve of serous pericardium.
</div>
<div>
  C The heart tube elongates and rotates after the absorption of
  the dorsal mesocardium (lateral view). At each end of the tube
  the vessels are still surrounded by the same single sleeve of
  pericardium as in B.
</div>
<div>
  D Ventral view of the adult pericardium after removal of the
  heart. The arterial and venous vessels are still surrounded by
  their single sleeves of serous pericardium with the transverse
  sinus between them; the aorta and pulmonary trunk are within one
  sleeve, and the two venae cavae and four pulmonary veins in the
  other. The oblique sinus is simply a cul-de-sac resulting from
  the wide separation of the four pulmonary veins.
</div>
