### Text
Generally speaking, the heart valves are best auscultated at the areas where the blood-containing chambers are nearest to the {{c1::chest wall}}.

### Extra
For the tricuspid valve this is over its surface, but for the
mitral valve it is at the apex beat, where the cavity of the left
ventricle lies nearest the surface. For the aortic valve it is
where the ascending aorta lies nearest the surface, at the right
sternal margin in the second intercostal space. For the pulmonary
valve it is at the left sternal margin at the third costal
cartilage (over the infundibulum of the right ventricle).
