  Does the position of the heart tend to vary much between the
  respiratory phases? {{c1::No}}

### Extra
<p id="dd1cf008-3797-4617-9092-a193563aa731" class="">During
descent of the central tendon of the diaphragm in full inspiration
the apex of the heart descends more than the relatively fixed base,
and the heart occupies a somewhat more vertical position (Fig.
4.10). In full expiration the ascent of the diaphragm forces the
heart into the more horizontal position characteristic of the
cadaver (Fig. 4.9), but these differences in position are not very
great.
