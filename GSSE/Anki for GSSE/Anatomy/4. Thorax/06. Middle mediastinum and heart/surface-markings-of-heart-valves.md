### Remarks
As far as the valves are concerned, they all lie behind the sternum, making a line with each other that is nearly vertical (Fig. 4.26). The bases of tricuspid and mitral valves, attached to the atrioventricular ring, are indicated by vertical lines over the lower part of the sternum. The tricuspid valve lies behind the midline of the lower sternum, the mitral valve, overlapping it, lies higher and somewhat to the left. The aortic and pulmonary orifices lie behind the left border of the sternum at the third costal cartilage; the pulmonary is the higher of the two.
