### Text
After the ACL becomes taught during extension, {{c1::internal}} rotation of the femur is still possible, causing the medial condyle to move backwards and tightening the {{c2::PCL, MCL, LCL::3 ligaments}}.

### Extra
This is the screw home mechanism, whereby all ligaments are tightened in knee extension and the knee is locked.
