T/F Medial rotation of the femur during the "screw home mechanism" is an active phenomena. {{c1::F}}

### Extra
The rotatary movements during extension (which may amount to 15Â° or
so), are <b>purely passive</b> and result from the skew pull of the
obliquely set ligaments.

  <u>Active medial rotation is performed by the
  semimembranosus/semitendinosus.</u>
