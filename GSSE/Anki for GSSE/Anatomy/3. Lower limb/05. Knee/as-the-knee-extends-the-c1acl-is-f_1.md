### Text
As the knee extends the {{c1::ACL}} is first to become taut (it limits extension of the lateral condyle it is attached to). However internal rotation of the femur is still possible, causing the medial condyle to move {{c2::backwards}} and tightening the other ligaments.

### Extra
The final degrees of extension are achieved by the lowest fibres of vastus medialis. 
This is known as the screw home mechanism where all the ligaments are taut and there is no extension or rotation
