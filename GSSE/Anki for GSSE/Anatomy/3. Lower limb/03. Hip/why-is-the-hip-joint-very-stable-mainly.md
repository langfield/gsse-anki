### Text
Why is the hip joint very stable?
<div>
  Mainly because the articular surfaces of the acetabulum and
  femoral head are {{c1::congruous}} with each other.
  <div>
    The joint is further reinforced by the {{c2::ligaments}} on the
    outside of the capsule, especially the {{c2::iliofemoral}}.
  </div>
  <div>
    The {{c3::short rotator}} muscles of the gluteal region are
    important muscular stabilizers.
