### Text
What muscles cause {{c3::external rotation}} of the hip?
<div>
  {{c1::Piriformis, obturator internus and the gemelli, quadratus
  femoris and obturator externus::6}} (short external rotators)
  Assisted by {{c2::gluteus maximus}}.
</div>

### Extra
During rotation of the thigh the femoral neck swings backwards and forwards like a gate on its hinges, and the femoral head rotates in the acetabulum about a vertical axis as does a hinge.
