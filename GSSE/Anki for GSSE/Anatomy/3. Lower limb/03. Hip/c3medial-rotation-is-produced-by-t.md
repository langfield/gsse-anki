### Text
{{c3::Medial rotation}} is produced by the more anterior fibres of {{c1::gluteus medius and minimus::2}}, assisted by the {{c2::adductors::muscle group}} and {{c4::tensor fasciae latae}}.

### Extra
Acting from a fixed femur, the glutei of one side <b>not only
prevent drooping of the pelvis</b> to the opposite side during
walking but also produce the <i>forward movement of the opposite
side of the pelvis</i> when the leg of that side is swinging
forward (thus acting as lateral rotators of the pelvis instead of
medial rotators of the femur) It has long been believed that psoas
and iliacus, passing in front of the joint to their attachments on
the back of the femur, pull the neck forwards and so produce medial
rotation, but <b><u>electromyography does not support this
view</u></b>
