### Text
There is great morphological resemblance between soleus in the leg and {{c1::flexor digitorum superficialis}} in the forearm.

### Extra
They both have a fibrous arch spanning the bones in the
forearm/leg, with a neurovascular bundle passing through it.
<div>
  The flexor digitorum brevis muscle in the sole of the foot can be
  regarded as the divorced distal part of soleus, cut off from it
  by the posterior projection of the calcaneus.
