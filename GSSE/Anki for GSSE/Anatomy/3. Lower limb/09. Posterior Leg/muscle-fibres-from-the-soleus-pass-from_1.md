### Text
Muscle fibres from the soleus pass from the {{c1::anterior}} aponeurosis to the {{c2::posterior}} aponeurosis.  Only the {{c3::posterior}} aponeurosis is continued into the tendo calcaneus.

### Extra
<div>
  The muscle has a curious and characteristic structure: it is
  flat, and there is a dense aponeurosis upon either surface.
  Between the two aponeurotic lamellae lies the great bulk of the
  soleus, made up of muscle fibres that slope downwards from the
  anterior to the posterior lamella; these fleshy fibres are
  visible at the medial and lateral borders of the muscle
