### Text
Soleus is a very powerful muscle because of the {{c1::multipennate}} arrangement of its muscle fibres.

### Extra
Pennate fibres are oriented at an angle to the direction of the
muscle contraction.
<div>
  - There is <b>less shortening</b> of the muscle during
  contraction compared to parallel fibres (ie a weaker
  contraction).
</div>
<div>
  - However a larger number of pennate fibres can fit in a muscle
  belly compared to parallel fibres and so therefore <b>the power
  generated is greater</b>.
  <div>
    Multipennate fibres have multiple rows of pennate fibres,
    allowing for further increase in power.
