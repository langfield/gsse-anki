### Front
T/F: In the hand and feet, the first metarcarpal with its two phalanges has 'broken free' and can be opposed to the other four.

### Back
False. <b>Only in the hand does this occur</b>, thus enabling
objects to be gripped. The foot is relatively fixed, and the first
metatarsal bone has <b>little power of free movement</b>
