### Text
Axis of the foot passes through the {{c1::second}} metatarsal, while in the hand the axis remains the {{c2::middle (i.e. third)}} metacarpal.

### Extra
All five metatarsals are weight bearing and in propulsion it is the
big toe side from which the 'take off is made. This has resulted in
a shifting of the axis of the human foot towards the tibial side.
