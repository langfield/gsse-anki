### Text
{{c1::Flexor digitorum superficialis}} has a wide origin from both forearm bones and from a fibrous arch between them. {{c2::Soleus}} has a similar origin in the leg.

### Extra
They both insert into the intermediate phalanges, though in the
case of soleus the muscle mass has been interrupted by the backward
projection of the calcaneus. A further muscle belly persists in the
sole of the foot (flexor digitorum brevis) continues to insert into
the intermediate phalanges.
