### Text
In the thigh the adductors have been specialized into {{c1::adductors longus, brevis and magnus, gracilis and part of pectineus::muscles}}, while in the arm the adductor mass of muscle has degenerated phylogenetically into the small {{c2::coracobrachialis}} muscle

### Extra
It is condensed around the musculocutaneous nerve.
<div>
  Adduction of the upper limb is instead served by a new mass of
  muscle, the great sheets of the anterior and posterior walls of
  the axilla, pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi.
