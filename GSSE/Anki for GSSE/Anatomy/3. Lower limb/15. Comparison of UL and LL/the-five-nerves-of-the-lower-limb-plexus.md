### Text
The five nerves of the lower limb plexus are {{c1::L4, 5, S1, 2, 3}} in the sacral plexus. They do not supply the {{c2::quadriceps}} and {{c2::adductors}}, which are derived from muscle 'borrowed from the trunk'.

### Extra
All muscles of the upper limb are supplied from the brachial plexus
