### Text
The more important action of the lumbricals is to assist in {{c1::extension of the interphalangeal joints}} and flexion of the {{c2::metatarsophalangeal joints}} through its attachment to the extensor expansion.

### Extra
The adducting and abducting actions of the interossei <b>are of
little significance</b> in the human foot.
<div>
  The action of the interossei and lumbricals are comparable to
  those in the hand, although abduction and adduction play a
  greater role.
