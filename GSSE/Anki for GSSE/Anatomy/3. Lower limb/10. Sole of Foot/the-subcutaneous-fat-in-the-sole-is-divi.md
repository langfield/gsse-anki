### Text
The subcutaneous fat in the sole is divided into {{c1::loculi}} which are filled with {{c2::fat}}, and this functions as a {{c3::shock absorber}}.

### Extra
This is especially prominent over the weight-bearing areas of the sole, e.g. the heel, the heads of the metatarsophalangeal joints and the toes.
