### Text
What is the action of flexor accessorius? By pulling on the
{{c1::tendons of flexor digitorum longus}}, it provides a means of
{{c2::flexing}} the lateral four toes in {{c3::any position::what
position}} of the ankle joint, particularly in full plantarflexion
(here the flexor digitorum longus is so shortened as to be out of
action).

### Extra
Comparable to that of extensor hallicus brevis/longus in full
dorsiflexion. <img src=
