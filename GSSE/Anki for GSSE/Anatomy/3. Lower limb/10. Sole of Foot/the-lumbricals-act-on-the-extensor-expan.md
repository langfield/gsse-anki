### Text
<div>
  The lumbricals act on the extensor expansion to {{c1::maintain
  extension of the interphalangeal joints::function}} during
  {{c3::flexion}} of the metatarsophalangeal joints. This is
  important in {{c2::walking}} so that the toes do not buckle.
</div>

### Extra
The action of the lumbricals is the same in the hand: maintaining
extension of the IP joints while the flexors act on the MCP joints
(waving bye bye)

<div>
  The lumbricals extend the IP joints whilst allowing for flexion
  at the MTP joints because of their insertion into the extensor
  hood distal to the MTP joint.
</div>
