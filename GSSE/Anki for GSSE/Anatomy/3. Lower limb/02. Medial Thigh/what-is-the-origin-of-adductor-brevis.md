### Text
What is the origin of adductor brevis?
<div>
  <div>
    {{c1::Body}} and {{c2::inferior ramus}} of the pubis
  </div>
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  Note that its origin is below the origin of adductor longus, it
  therefore lies under adductor longus and most of it cannot be
  seen in a superficial dissection
