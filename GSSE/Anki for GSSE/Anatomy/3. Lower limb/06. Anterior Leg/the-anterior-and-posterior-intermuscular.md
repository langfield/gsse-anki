### Text
The anterior and posterior intermuscular septum pass from the deep surface of the {{c2::deep fascia}} of the leg to attach to the {{c1::fibula}}, therefore separating the leg into three compartments.

### Extra
<div>
  The posterior compartment is further divided by the aponeurotic
  origin of flexor digitorum longus into deep and superficial
  compartments.
