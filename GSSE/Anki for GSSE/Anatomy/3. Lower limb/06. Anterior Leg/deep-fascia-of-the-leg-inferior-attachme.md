### Text
Deep fascia of the leg inferior attachments are the {{c1::lateral malleolus}} and adjacent triangular subcutaneous area on the {{c2::fibula}}. On the tibia it is attached to the {{c3::anterior}} and {{c3::posterior}} borders of the tibia.

### Extra
On the medial side, the <b>subcutaneous border continues down as
the medial malleolus</b> and therefore the attachment of the deep
fascia on the medial side is the edges of the medial malleolus.
