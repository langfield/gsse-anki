### Text
The tendon of adductor longus arises from the front of the body of the pubis, between the {{c1::pubic crest}} and {{c2::pubic symphysis}}.

### Extra
<div>
  Its origin lies superior to the adductor brevis and magnus
  muscles and therefore it is the most superficial of the 3 as they
  pass to the femur.
