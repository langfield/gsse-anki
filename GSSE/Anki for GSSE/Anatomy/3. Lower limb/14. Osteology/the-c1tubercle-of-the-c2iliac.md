### Text
The {{c1::tubercle}} of the {{c2::iliac crest}} is the most lateral part of the pelvis.

### Extra
From the ASIS, the iliac crest slopes up and laterally to the
tubercle which is the most lateral part. It is not the most
superior part however, as the iliac crest continues to rise beyond
the tubercle.
