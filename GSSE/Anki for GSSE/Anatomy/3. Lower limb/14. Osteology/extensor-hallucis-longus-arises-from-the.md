### Text
Extensor hallucis longus arises from the {{c1::middle two-fourths}} of the fibula and the adjacent {{c2::interosseous membrane}}.

### Extra
<div>
  It arises from the anterior (extensor) surface of the fibula.
</div>
<div>
  Its origin is medial to that of extensor digitorum longus, and
  the position of the tendon is preserved (medial to EDL) as it
  enters the foot.
</div>
<div>
  This is in contrast to flexor hallicus longus which arises
  lateral to flexor digitorum longus, and the tendons must cross
  over in the foot.
