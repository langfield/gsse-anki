### Text
The synovial joints between the three cuneiforms and between the lateral cuneiform and cuboid all lie at the {{c1::upper}} limits of the adjacent surfaces.

### Extra
The broad lower parts of these surfaces give strong fixation to plantar interosseous ligaments that bind the bones firmly together in the transverse arch of the foot.
