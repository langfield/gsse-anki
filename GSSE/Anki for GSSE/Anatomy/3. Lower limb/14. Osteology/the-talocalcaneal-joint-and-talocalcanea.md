### Text
The talocalcaneal joint and talocalcaneal part of the talocalcaneonavicular joint constitute the "{{c1::subtalar}}" joint.

### Extra
<div>
  The "subtalar" joint is where eversion and inversion occur.
</div>
<div>
  Strictly speaking subtalar only refers to the talocalcaneal joint
  but the two joints serve the same function and thus when
  clinicians refer to the subtalar joint they are referring to
  both.
