### Text
The {{c1::first}} metatarsal forms its own synovial cavity with its corresponding cuneiform.

### Extra
The other four metatarsal bases, articulating with intermediate and
lateral cuneiforms and the cuboid, and with each other, share a
common joint space.
<div>
  This space extends back alongside the intermediate cuneiform into
  the joint between the cuneiforms and the navicular.
