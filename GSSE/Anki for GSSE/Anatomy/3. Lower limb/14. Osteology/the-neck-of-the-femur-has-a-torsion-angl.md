### Text
The neck of the femur has a torsion angle of {{c1::30 degrees}} with the shaft.

### Extra
<img src="paste-7248446274d9ce6d2a2f7375e075b96e364cfeef.jpg">
<div>
  The plane of the neck of the femur is not parallel to the plane
  of the shaft, they lie at angles to each other. Therefore if a
  femur is laid to rest on the table, the condyles will contact the
  table but the head and neck will rise off the table.
