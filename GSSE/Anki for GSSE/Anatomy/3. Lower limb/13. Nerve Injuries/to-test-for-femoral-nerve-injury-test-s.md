### Text
<div>
  To test for femoral nerve injury, test sensation over the
  {{c1::anterior thigh}} and {{c2::medial leg}}.
</div>

### Extra
Always test the most distal part of the nerve supply and work
proximally. However since the femoral nerve has so many branches,
the branches for sensation should be tested separately (cutaneous
nerves of thigh and saphenous nerve)
