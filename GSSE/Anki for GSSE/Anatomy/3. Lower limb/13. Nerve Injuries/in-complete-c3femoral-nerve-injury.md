### Text
<div>
  In complete {{c3::femoral}} nerve injury, there is total loss of
  {{c1::knee extension}} and some weakness in {{c2::hip flexion}}.
</div>

### Extra
It supplies the quadriceps responsible for knee extension, and it
supplies rectus femoris which assists hip flexion. Note that it
also supplies iliacus which is a hip flexor but the branches to
iliacus are given off before the muscle and nerve enter the leg.
