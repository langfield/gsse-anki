### Text
<div>
  The {{c2::femoral}} nerve is most prone to {{c1::penetrating}}
  injuries due to its relatively {{c3::superficial}} course in the
  thigh.
</div>

### Extra
It branches into several branches as it passes under the inguinal
ligament (4 superficial and 5 deep) and thus is at risk of
penetrating injuries to the thigh.
