### Text
Within the anterior abdominal wall, the ilioinguinal nerve lies in a neurovascular plane between the {{c1::internal oblique::abdominal wall muscle}} and {{c1::transversus abdominis::abdominal wall muscle}}

### Extra
<div>
  In the anterior abdominal wall it lies in the neurovascular plane
  between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles,
  pierces internal oblique and supplies its lower fibres, and
  passes down beneath the external oblique (Fig. 5.9, p. 302) to
  emerge on the front of the cord through the superficial inguinal
  ring.
</div>
<div>
  At this point you might want to recall the bit from "Introduction
  to regional anatomy: nervous system" where it's mentioned that
  the ventral ramus of the spinal nerve typically passes between
  the middle and deepest muscular layers
