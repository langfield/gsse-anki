### Text
The gutter of the {{c2::adductor}} canal is roofed in by a fascia which contains in its meshes the {{c1::subsartorial plexus}}. The plexus supplies the
overlying {{c3::fascia lata}} and an area of skin above the {{c4::medial}} side of the knee.

### Extra
The subsartorial plexus receives small branches from the
intermediate cutaneous nerve of the thigh, the saphenous nerve and
the anterior division of the obturator nerve. <img src=
