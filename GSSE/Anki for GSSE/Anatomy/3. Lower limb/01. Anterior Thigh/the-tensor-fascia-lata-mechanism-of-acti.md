### Text
The tensor fascia lata mechanism of action is to pull on its insertion (the {{c1::iliotibial tract}}) and thereby assist gluteus maximus in {{c2::extending}} the knee and supporting the knee joint in extension.

### Extra
Quadriceps is the main extensor of the knee - however tensor fascia lata and the ITB maintain extension when quietly standing (and the quadriceps is relaxed).
