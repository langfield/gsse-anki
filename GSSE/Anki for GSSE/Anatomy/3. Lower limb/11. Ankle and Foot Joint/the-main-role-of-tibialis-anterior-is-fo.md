### Text
The main role of tibialis anterior is for {{c1::shock absorbing}} during walking. It contracts {{c2::eccentrically}} (the muscle lengthens as it contracts) to lower the forefoot to the ground gently when taking a step.

### Extra
Tibialis anterior is most active around heel strike to lower the
foot gently to the ground. <img src=
