### Text
The axis of rotation at the ankle joint passes through both malleoli and therefore is not {{c1::horizontal}}. {{c3::Plantarflexion}} will be accompanied by "{{c2::inversion}}", and {{c3::dorsiflexion}} will be accompanied by "{{c2::eversion}}".

### Extra
This is <b>not true eversion of the foot</b>, which takes place at
the <u>subtalar and talocalcaneonavicular joint</u>. Although the
foot moves the same way the eversion and eversion that accompany
plantar and dorsiflexion are occuring via a different mechanism.
