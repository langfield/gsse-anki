### Text
Dorsiflexion is produced by {{c1::tibialis anterior}} and {{c2::peroneus tertius}}, assisted by the {{c3::long extensors}}.

### Extra
Peroneus tertius in spite of its small size has a <b>good
mechanical advantage</b> due to its <b>long lever arm</b> (its
tendon passes a considerable distance in front of the axis of
rotation).
