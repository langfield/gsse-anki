### Text
The talonavicular part of the talocalcaneonavicular joint is comprised of the {{c1::head}} of the talus articulating with the navicular, and the undersurface of the talar head articulating with the {{c2::sustentaculum tali}} and {{c3::spring ligament}}.

### Extra
<div>The head of the talus sits in the talocalcaneonavicular joint
formed by the navicular and anterior/middlearticular surfaces of
the calcaneus (left). The <b>socket</b> of the talonavicular part
of the joint is formed by the articular surface on the navicular
and the spring ligament and sustentaculum tali which form the
floor. Hence the undersurface of the head articulates with the
spring ligament and sustentaculum tali. <img src=
