### Text
The movements of inversion and eversion begin at the {{c1::midtarsal joint}} but most of range of motion occurs at the {{c2::subtalar}} joints.

### Extra
<div>
  The movement of inversion/eversion begin at the midtarsal joint
  <u>because the tibialis and peroneus muscles are attached
  here.</u> However there is <u>very little movement permitted</u>
  so the <b>force is transmitted to the subtalar joints</b>.
</div>The subtalar comprises of the talocalcaneal joint posteriorly
(green) and the talocalcaneal part of the talocalcaneonavicular
joint anteriorly (purple and blue).
