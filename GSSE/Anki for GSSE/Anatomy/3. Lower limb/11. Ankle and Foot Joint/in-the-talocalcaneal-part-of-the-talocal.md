### Text
In the <b>talocalcaneal</b> part of the talocalcaneonavicular
joint, the {{c1::underside}} of the {{c4::head}} of the talus
articulates with the {{c2::anterior talar}} surface and
{{c3::middle talar}} surface of the calcaneus.

### Extra
<div>
  In the image we are looking at the talus from below, and the
  dotted line below represents the underside of the head of the
  talus (the blue, white and pink areas are <b>actually one
  continuous structure</b> lined with hyaline cartilage).
  <div>
    The talus anteriorly articulates with 2 facets on the anterior
    calcaneus, as well as the navicular (the talonavicular joint
    labelled C), and they all lie in the same synovial cavity.
  </div>
  <div>
    The posterior articulation between the talus and calcaneus is
    shown in green.
