### Text
Extension of the toes during walking helps to {{c1::shorten the plantar aponeurosis}} which supports the medial longitudinal arch, and elongates the {{c2::flexor hallicus/digitorum longus::2}} muscles to increase the force of their contraction.

### Extra
This occurs when the heel is rising from the ground after a step has been taken.
