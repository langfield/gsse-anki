### Text
Tibialis anterior and posterior support the arch by pulling on its insertions to {{c1::invert}} and {{c1::adduct}} the foot, thereby raising the arch from the ground.

### Extra
This is mechanically inferior to the bowstring/tie beam effect which is the most important factor in maintaining the arch.
