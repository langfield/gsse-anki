### Text
The {{c1::peroneus longus}} tendon pulls the metatarsal bones together (like a tie beam) and therefore supports the {{c2::transverse arch}} of the foot.

### Extra
The peroneus longus tendon is the most important factor in
maintaining the transverse arch because of its tie beam/bowstring
effect.
<div>
  The ligaments that bind together the cuneiforms and bases of the
  five metatarsal bones also help maintain the transverse arch
