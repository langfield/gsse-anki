### Text
The peroneus longus helps to maintain the {{c1::lateral longitudinal}} and {{c2::transverse}} arch of the foot.

### Extra
<div>
  It traverses across the transverse arch of the foot, and so
  pulling on the tendon helps maintain the transverse arch. By the
  same mechanism it supports the lateral longitudinal arch of the
  foot. It does <b>NOT</b> support the medial longitudinal arch of
  the foot - in fact it antagonises the muscles which support the
  arch.

  side of the medial cuneiform and 1st MT to approximate the medial
  and lateral borders of the foot (supporting the transverse arch).

  It also pulls in an AP direction to maintain the lateral
  longitudinal arch.
