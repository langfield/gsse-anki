### Text
The membranous labyrinth is supplied by the {{c1::cochlear (hearing)}} and {{c1::vestibular (balance)}} divisions of the eighth nerve.

### Extra
<div>
  There is no known reason why hearing and balance are so
  intimately connected in the same peripheral structure and
  innervated by the same cranial nerve.
