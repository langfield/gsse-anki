### Original
The likely mechanism for the organ of Corti is that [[oc1::sound vibrations]] are communicated from the [[oc2::perilymph]] to the [[oc2::endolymph]] through the [[oc3::delicate vestibular membrane]] and cause appropriate fibres in the [[oc4::basilar membrane]] to bulge which [[oc5::stimulates overlying hair cells.]]
