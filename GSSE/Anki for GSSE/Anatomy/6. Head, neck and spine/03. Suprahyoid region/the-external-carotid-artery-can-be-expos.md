The external carotid artery can be exposed in front of the upper part of the sternocleidomastoid before entering the parotid gland by ligating the {{c1::facial vein::vessel}} and incising the carotid sheath. Care must be taken not to damage the {{c1::hypoglossal nerve::structure}} which crosses the external and internal carotids superficially.
