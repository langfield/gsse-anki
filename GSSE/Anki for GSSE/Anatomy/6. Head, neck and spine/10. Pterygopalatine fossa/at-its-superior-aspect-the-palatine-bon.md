### Text
At its superior aspect, the palatine bone bifurcates, the anteriolateral limb remains attached to the {{c1::maxilla::bone}}, also forming a part of {{c1::the orbital}} floor. The posteromedial part passes back to articulate with the {{c1::sphenoid::bone}}. Between the two lies the {{c2::sphenopalatine}} foramen, which connects the {{c2::pterygopalatine}} fossa with the {{c2::lateral wall of the nose}}.
