The secretomotor fibres to lacrimal gland leave the cell bodies in the pterygopalatine ganglion, join the {{c1::maxillary nerve}} through the stout connection, pass in its {{c1::zygomatic}} branch into the orbit, then joins the {{c2::lacrimal}} branch of the {{c2::ophthalmic}} nerve to reach the gland.
