### Text
In the pterygopalatine fossa, the maxillary artery lies
{{c1::below::above/below}} the maxillary nerve and gives off
branches that pass with the five branches of the ganglion.
<div>
  The only branch of the maxillary artery that does not follow this
  distribution is the {{c1::infraorbital}} artery.
</div>

### Extra
However, the infraorbital artery enters the orbit through the inferior orbital fissure and follows the course of the infraorbital nerve through the infraorbital foramen.
