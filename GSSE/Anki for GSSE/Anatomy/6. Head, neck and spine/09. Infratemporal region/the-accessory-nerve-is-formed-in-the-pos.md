### Text
The accessory nerve is formed in the posterior cranial fossa by the union of the cranial root from {{c1::nucleus ambiguus::medulla structure}} and spinal root from {{c1::accessory nucleus in the ventral horn of C1-C5}} which pass up into the cranial fossa through the {{c1::foramen magnum}}. All the cranial fibres are then given to the vagus nerve promptly after exiting, leaving just the spinal accessory nerves.

  Why the heck didn't the cranial root just leave the medulla with
  the vagus nerve then???????????? Nature you so funny.
