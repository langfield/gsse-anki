### Text
The inferior ganglion of the vagus nerve receives a large branch from the {{c1::accessory}} nerve just as it exits the jugular foramen. The fibres from this branch originate in the {{c1::nucleus ambiguus::brainstem structure}} and supply {{c2::all the striated muscle of the viscera (pharynx, soft palate, oesophagus, larynx)}}.

### Extra
So essentially the cranial part of the accessory nerve carries these fibres for the vagus nerve until it exits the vault.
