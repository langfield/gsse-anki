### Text
The masseteric nerve not only innervates muscle, but gives an {{c1::articular}} branch to {{c1::the TMJ}}. This is called {{c2::Hilton's}} Law.

### Extra
<span style="color: rgb(32, 33, 34);">Hilton's Law (John Hilton
1860) says that the nerve supplying the muscles extending directly
across and acting at a given joint not only supplies the muscle,
but also innervates the joint and the skin overlying the
muscle</span>
