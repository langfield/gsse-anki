### Text
The infrahyoid strap muscles are in the same plane of the body wall
musculature as what other muscle of the abdominal wall?

  {{c1::Rectus abdominis.}}
</div>

### Extra
Another strange yet interesting Last's 'segue'
<div>
  One should picture the rectus sheet as extending from chin to
  pubic symphysis, supplied segmentally from C1 to T12 spinal nerve
  but interrupted by intervention from the thoracic cage. There are
  sometimes remnants of the longitudinal strip sometimes overlying
  the pectoralis major, an anatomical anomaly called rectus
  sternalis.
