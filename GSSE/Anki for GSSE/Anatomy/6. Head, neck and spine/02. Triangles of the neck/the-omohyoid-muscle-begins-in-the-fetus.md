### Text
The omohyoid muscle begins in the fetus as a {{c1::longitudinal::orientation}} strip attached to the {{c2::medial end of the clavicle::bony landmark}}

### Extra
In this respect, it is similar to the other infrahyoid muscles during fetal development. The reason it ultimately changes is because of migration along the clavicle during development â†’ reaches adult attachment to scapula
