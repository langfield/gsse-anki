### Text
The anterior horn cells of the segments supplying sternocleidomastoid are innervated by {{c1::ipsilateral::ipsilateral/contralateral}} cerebral cortex.

### Extra
<div>
  Meanwhile, those supplying the trapezius receive the usual
  contralateral innervation.
</div>The reason is that when, for example, the left upper limb
muscles (including trapezius) are being used and the head is turned
to that side to see what is going on, it is the right
sternocleidomastoid that is turning the head to the left; the same
(right) cortex controls all the muscles.
