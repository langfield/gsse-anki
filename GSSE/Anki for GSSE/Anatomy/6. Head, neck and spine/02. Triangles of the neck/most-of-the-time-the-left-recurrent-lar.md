### Text
Most of the time, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve lies {{c1::behind::relation}} the inferior thyroid artery

### Extra

<div>
  The way I like to rationalise this difference is since the RLN
  loops from lower down on the left, it is given more chance to go
  behind the inferior thyroid artery, which originates as
  thyrocervical trunk from the subclavian artery.
