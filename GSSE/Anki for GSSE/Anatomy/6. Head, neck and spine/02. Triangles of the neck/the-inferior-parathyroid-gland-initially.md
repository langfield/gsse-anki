### Text
The inferior parathyroid gland initially develops {{c1::above::below/above}} the superior parathyroid gland.

### Extra
It therefore has further to migrate than the superior and is more liable to end up in unusual positions. About 10% of inferior glands are found within the capsule of the thymus.
