### Text
Both the left and right recurrent laryngeal nerve have documented variants where they can travel {{c1::between::relative relation}} branches of the inferior thyroid artery

### Extra

<div>
  The way I like to rationalise this difference is since the RLN
  loops from lower down on the left, it is given more chance to go
  behind the inferior thyroid artery, which originates as
  thyrocervical trunk from the subclavian artery.
