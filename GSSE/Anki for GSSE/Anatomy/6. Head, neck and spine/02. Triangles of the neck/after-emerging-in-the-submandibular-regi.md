### Text
After emerging in the submandibular region, the hypoglossal nerve hooks around the {{c1::occipital}} artery to curve forward over the {{c3::external carotid}} artery and loop of the {{c2::lingual}} artery, while lying underneath the {{c4::intermediate tendon of digastric::muscular landmark}}

### Extra
<div>
  <div>
    In the submandibular region, the hypoglossal nerve emerges
    between the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein
    deep to the posterior belly of the digastric. Hooking around
    the occipital artery it curves forwards over the external
    carotid and loop of the lingual artery.
  </div>
  <div>
    As it crosses these three arteries, it lies just below the
    digastric, behind its tendon just above the tip of the greater
    horn of the hyoid bone. Here it gives off the superior root of
    the ansa cervicalis.
  </div>
  <div>
    It continues forwards on the surface of the hyoglossus which
    separates it from the lingual artery, giving the branch to
    thyrohyoid (C1 fibres) then running deep to mylohyoid to enter
    the mouth.
