### Text
<div>
  An {{c1::axial line}} between two adjacent dermatomes is a line
  that is not represented by immediately adjacent spinal levels
</div>

### Extra
Although dermatomes are shown to be discrete segments on dermatomal
maps (like in the image opposite), they are in fact not; adjacent
dermatomes overlap with one another. This is one of the reasons for
the variety of different dermatomal maps proposed. <u style=
"">However, at axial lines, adjacent dermatomes do not overlap.</u>
(todo: add image)
