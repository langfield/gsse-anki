### Text
After passing between the superficial sheet and deep fibres to enter the sternocleidomastoid, the accessory nerve then runs down within it to emerge into the {{c1::posterior}} triangle about halfway down its {{c2::posterior}} border

### Extra
<div>
  Cannot find an image of muscular components online, but clinical
  importance with locating accessory nerve, particularly during
  selective neck dissections when delineating 2a and 2b nodal
  levels.
