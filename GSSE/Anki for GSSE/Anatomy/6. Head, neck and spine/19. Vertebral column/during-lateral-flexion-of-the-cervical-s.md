### Text
<div>
  During lateral flexion of the cervical spine, the neural arch of
  the abducted vertebra slides {{c1::downwards and backwards}}
  towards the {{c2::concave}} side of the lateral bend, and
  {{c1::upwards and forwards}} towards the {{c2::convex}} side of
  the lateral bend.
</div>
<div>
  This results in a slight concomitant {{c3::rotation}} of the
  {{c3::abducted vertebrae}} towards the concavity of the lateral
  bend.
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  Recall that, In the cervical region, other than at the
  atlanto-occipital and atlantoaxial joints, upper facets face
  backwards and upwards, whilst lower facets face forwards and
  downwards.
