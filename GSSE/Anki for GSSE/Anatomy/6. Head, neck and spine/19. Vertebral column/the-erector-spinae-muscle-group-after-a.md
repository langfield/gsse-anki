### Text
<div>
  The erector spinae muscle group, after arising from the sacrum
  and iliac crest, passes {{c1::upwards and slightly outwards}}
  dividing as it does so into two main bundles (although there is
  third more medial bundle of fibres called the spinalis part):
  {{c2::iliocostalis}} laterally and {{c3::longissimus}} medially.
</div>
