### Text
<div>
  When a disc herniates, the nerve root irritated is typically that
  which is numbered {{c1::one below}} the level of the disc.

  <ul>
    <li>Hence, the L5-S1 disc irritates the S1 nerve root, the
    L4-L5 disc irritates the L5 nerve root, and the C6-C7 disc
    irritates the C7 nerve root.
    <li>These are the commonest clinical examples of disc
    herniation.
    <li>Lastâ€™s Anatomy states that C6-C7 disc herniation would
    rather irritate the C8 nerve root, but most other sources agree
    that the C7 nerve root is affected instead. Although there is
    one more cervical nerve root than there are cervical vertebrae,
    the cervical spinal nerves exit the spinal cord at a less
    oblique angle (as per the diagram below).
