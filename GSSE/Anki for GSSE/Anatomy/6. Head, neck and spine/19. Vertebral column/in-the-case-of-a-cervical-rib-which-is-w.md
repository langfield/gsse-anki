### Text
<div>
  In the case of a cervical rib which is well developed, the
  brachial plexus is more likely to be prefixed such that its roots
  are {{c1::C4-C8}}
</div>

### Extra
Instead of the normal C5-T1.
Recall that there are 8 cervical nerves and 7 cervical
vertebrae. C1-C7 emerge above their corresponding vertebrae, while C8 emerges
below the C7 vertebra. Thus, a prefixed brachial plexus preserves the normal
nerve to rib relationship.
