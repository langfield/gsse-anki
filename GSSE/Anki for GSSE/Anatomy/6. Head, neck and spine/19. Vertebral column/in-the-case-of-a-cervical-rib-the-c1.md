### Text
<div>
  In the case of a cervical rib, the {{c1::subclavian}} artery and
  {{c2::T1 (lowest) root of the brachial plexus::nerve structure}}
  become displaced upwards over such a rib or band and are
  compressed from below.
</div>

### Extra
This leads to the presentation of thoracic outlet syndrome (which
can also be caused by other compressions of the same structures
e.g. a Pancoast's tumour)
