### Text
<div>
  After iliocostalis fibres insert into the angles of the lower 6
  ribs and new muscle bundles arise and pass upwards to be attached
  to the angle of the 6<sup>th</sup> rib above, further new fibres
  run up to insert into the {{c2::transverse processes}} of the
  {{c1::lower 4 cervical vertebrae}}.
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  You can think of iliocostalis as running onto (what remains of)
  the (embryological) costal elements of the cervical vertebrae
  once it runs out of ribs to run onto
