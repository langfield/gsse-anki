### Text
<div>
  The posterior longitudinal ligament has serrated margins and is
  broadest over the {{c1::discs}} to which it is {{c3::firmly}}
  attached, and narrowest over the {{c2::vertebral bodies}} to
  which it is {{c3::more loosely}} attached.
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  The posterior longitudinal ligament is narrowest over the
  vertebral bodies to give free exit to the basivertebral veins
  emerging from the backs of the bodies.
</div>
<div>
  cf. the anterior longitudinal ligaments, which are firmly united
  to the vertebral body periosteum but less so to the discs
</div>
