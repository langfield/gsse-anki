### Text
The thyroid gland tends not to extend upward in goitre due to limitation by the attachment of the {{c1::sternothyroid::muscle}} on the {{c2::oblique line of the thyroid cartilage::landmark}}

### Extra
The upper limit of the pretracheal fascia is the attachments of the infrahyoid  muscles. Hence, the thyroid gland is particularly limited by the attachment of the sternothyroid on the oblique line of the thyroid cartilage. Meanwhile, there are no limitations to expansion inferiorly, leading to retrosternal goitre in severe cases.
