### Text
The {{c1::inner}} layer of the thyroid gland's fibrous capsule septates its tissue into microscopic lobules.

### Extra
The thyroid gland is covered by a thin fibrous capsule, which has
an inner and an outer layer. The inner layer extrudes into the
gland and forms the septae that divides the thyroid tissue into
microscopic lobules. The outer layer is continuous with the
pretracheal fascia, attaching the gland to the cricoid and thyroid
cartilages via a thickening of the fascia to form the posterior
suspensory ligament of thyroid gland, also known as Berry's
ligament. This causes the thyroid to move up and down with the
movement of these cartilages when swallowing occurs.

  Last's says "[The pretracheal fascia] splits to enclose the
  thyroid gland, to which it is not adherent except between the
  isthmus and second, third and fourth rings of the trachea.
