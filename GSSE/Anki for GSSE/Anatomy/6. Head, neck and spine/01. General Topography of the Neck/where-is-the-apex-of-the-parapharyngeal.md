### Extra
<div>
  <div>
    The parapharyngeal space is a pyramidal space with its base at
    the base of skull and the apex at the hyoid bone.
  </div>
  <div>
    It is bound medially by the buccopharyngeal mucosa, laterally
    by the medial pterygoid muscle and parotid sheath, anteriorly
    by the pterygomandibular raphe and posteriorly by the
    prevertebral fascia (posterolateral) and retropharyngeal space
    (posteromedial).
  </div>
  <div>
    It is split into an pre-styloid and post-styloid compartment by
    the stylopharyngeal fascia. Some sources only recognise
    pre-styloid compartment as true parapharyngeal space, while
    calling post-styloid compartment carotid space.
  </div>
  <div>
    Nevertheless, The post-styloid compartment contains important
    vessels, including but not limited to CN IX, X, XI, internal
    carotid artery, internal jugular vein.
