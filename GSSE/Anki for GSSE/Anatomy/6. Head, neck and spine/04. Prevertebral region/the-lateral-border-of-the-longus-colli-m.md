The lateral border of the longus colli muscle forms a pyramidal
space with the medial border of the scalenus anterior. What is at
the apex of this space?

  {{c1::The anterior tubercle of C6, AKA the carotid tubercle of
  Chassaignac}}

  This is clinically significant as the common carotid artery
  asccends directly in front of this tubercle. It is the ideal site
  to palpate the carotid pulse by gently pressing the artery
  against it. The surface marking of this site is just lateral to
  the cricoid cartilage.
