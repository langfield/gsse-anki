The supraorbital and supratrochlear arteries are branches of the {{c1::ophthalmic}} artery. Supraorbital is the {{c2::larger::smaller/larger}} artery and lies {{c2::lateral::medial/lateral}} to the supratrochlear.

  The supraorbital is largely responsible for supply of the front
  of the scalp up to the vertex. As mentioned in another card, its
  anastamosis with the superficial temporal artery connects the
  internal and external carotid systems.
