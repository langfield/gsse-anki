### Text
The skin of the forehead from the orbit is supplied by {{c1::the supraorbital and supratrochlear branches of the ophthalmic artery(first branch of the ICA distal to the cavernous sinus)}}. In the scalp, these anastamose freely with the {{c2::superficial temporal}} artery.

### Extra
Hence, this anastamosis is the only free communication between internal and external carotid systems.
