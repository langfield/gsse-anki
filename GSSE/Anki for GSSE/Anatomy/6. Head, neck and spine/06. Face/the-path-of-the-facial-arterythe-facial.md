### Text
The path of the facial artery
<div>
  The facial artery passes upwards on the sidewall of the pharynx
  and hooks downwards over {{c1::the posterior belly of the
  digastric}} to come into contact with {{c1::the upper surface of
  the subandibular gland}}. It then hooks upwards over {{c2::the
  inferior border of the mandible}} at the {{c2::anterior border of
  the masseter muscle::where}}. It pursues a tortuous course
  towards {{c3::the medial angle of the eye}}, lying
  {{c3::deep::superficial/deep}} to the sheet of dilator muscles
  that radiate out from the lips.
</div>
