### Text
The parotid duct pierces the outer surface of the {{c1::buccinator}} muscle opposite the {{c1::third upperwhich}} molar tooth. The duct also passes through the buccal fat pad which lies on the {{c1::outer::inner/surface}} surface of the buccinator.

### Extra
The buccal fat pad is particularly prominent in infants, given them their chubby cheeks.
