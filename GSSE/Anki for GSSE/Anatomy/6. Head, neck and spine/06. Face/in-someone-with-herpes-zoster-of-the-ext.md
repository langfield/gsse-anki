### Text
In someone with herpes zoster of the external nasal nerve
distribution, why would you be worried about the eyes?
<div>
  {{c1::The external nasal nerve is a terminal branch of the
  anterior ethmoidal nerve, which is a branch of the nasocilliary
  nerve. The nasociliary is continuous proximally with the ciliary
  nerves which supplies the cornea. This all means that there could
  be corneal ulceration from herpes zoster.}}
