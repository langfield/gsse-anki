### Text
On the maxilla, the buccinator originates at the anterior border of
the {{c1::first}} molar, passing back horizontally to skirt the
root of the {{c1::zygomatic}} process of the maxilla, and curves
downwards to the {{c1::tuberosity}} of the maxilla.
<div>
  Here, there is a gap in the buccinator's bony origin as the
  muscle instead arises from a fibrous band called the
  {{c2::pterygomaxillary}} ligament. The ligament extends from the
  tip of the {{c2::hamulus::bony landmark}} to the nearest part of
  the {{c2::tuberosity of the maxilla::bony landmark}}.
</div>
<div>
  Through the gap above this ligament, the tendon of the
  {{c3::tensor palati}} passes and through hooks around the base of
  the {{c3::hamulus}}.
</div>
