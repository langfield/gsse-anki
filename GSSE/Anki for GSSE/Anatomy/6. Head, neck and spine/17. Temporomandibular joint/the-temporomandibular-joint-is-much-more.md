### Text
The temporomandibular joint is much more stable with the jaw {{c1::closed (occlusion)::position}} than {{c1::open::position}}.

### Extra
<div>
  You'll see Last's referring to the jaw-closed position of the TMJ
  as "with the teeth in occlusion" (to sound more anatomical;
  because that's literally what the teeth are doing, occluding the
  mouth)
