### Text
<div class="toggle">
  {{c1::C6, 7}} spinal segments flex the <em>wrist</em>, and
  {{c1::C6, 7}} extend.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="98e19618-a5a7-4eae-89a3-f80cfffeb35b" class="">In the upper
limb the two-and-two segment pattern is not as regular as in the
lower limb, probably because in the upper limb much more precise
movements are constantly being employed, and the spinal centres
have broken up into separate nuclei to control these. Thus below
the elbow the plan does not conform to the basic pattern of four
spinal segments for each joint. Flexion and extension share the
same two segments. But the rule holds that more distal joints are
innervated from lower centres in the cord.
