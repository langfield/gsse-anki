### Text
<div class="toggle">
  Generally muscles with a double nerve supply are {{c1::flexor}}
  muscles which receive a supply from the nerve of the
  {{c1::extensor}} compartment.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="c5bfe2af-2a46-4888-810e-82cf94999691" class="">This apparent
contradiction is due to embryological causes, namely that the
muscle concerned was developed in the extensor compartment of the
fetal limb but lies, for functional reasons, in the flexor
compartment of the adult limb, bringing its nerve with it. The
lateral portion of brachialis (supplied by the radial nerve) and
the short head of biceps femoris (supplied by the peroneal part of
the sciatic nerve) are examples of flexor muscles supplied by
extensor compartment nerves, and in each case the remainder of the
muscle is, in fact, supplied by a flexor compartment nerve.
