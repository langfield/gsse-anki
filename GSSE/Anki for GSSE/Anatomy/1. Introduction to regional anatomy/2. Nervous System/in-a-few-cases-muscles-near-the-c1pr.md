<div class="toggle">
  In a few cases muscles near the {{c1::preaxial}} or
  {{c1::postaxial}} border of a limb receive a double nerve supply.

### Extra
<p id="7f3af1d1-69e8-4095-a7fb-0da2f193bf69" class="">The lateral
portion of brachialis (supplied by the radial nerve) and the short
head of biceps femoris (supplied by the peroneal part of the
sciatic nerve) are examples of flexor muscles supplied by extensor
compartment nerves, and in each case the remainder of the muscle
is, in fact, supplied by a flexor compartment nerve.
