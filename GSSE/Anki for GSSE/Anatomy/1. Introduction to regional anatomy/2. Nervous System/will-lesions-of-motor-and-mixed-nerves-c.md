  Will lesions of motor and mixed nerves cause proprioceptive as
  well as motor loss?

### Extra
<p id="809d050a-2522-4609-8487-b54f2f909eb7" class="">It follows
that 'mixed nerves' with motor and cutaneous fibres must also
contain proprioceptive fibres, but purely 'cutaneous nerves' which
carry touch, pain and temperature fibres do not have those of
proprioceptive sensibility.
