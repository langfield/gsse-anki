### Text
<div class="toggle">
  In general the sympathetic supply of the body is represented
  upright from {{c1::head}} to {{c1::perineum}} with overlaps and
  individual variations.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="015eca3e-d443-451d-bae2-9668ee2061d0" class="">Thus although
the neurons concerned with the innervation of the upper limb are
shown as being in the lateral grey horns of segments Tl-6, those
from Tl segment mostly pass to postganglionic cells which innervate
head and neck structures; in only 10% of individuals are Tl cells
involved in the sympathetic supply to the upper limb, but the
lowest level involved may be as low as T10.
