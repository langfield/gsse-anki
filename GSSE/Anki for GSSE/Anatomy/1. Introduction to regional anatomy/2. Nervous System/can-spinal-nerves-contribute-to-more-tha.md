### Extra
<p id="ff97205a-f99a-4675-8a4d-74813eb79707" class="">Because of
the way nerve fibres become combined and rearranged in plexuses,
any one spinal nerve can contribute to more than one peripheral
nerve and peripheral nerves can receive fibres from more than one
spinal nerve. It follows that the area of skin supplied by any one
spinal nerve or spinal cord segment (dermatome) is not the same as
the area supplied by the particular spinal nerve. It is therefore
necessary to learn two kinds of skin maps or charts - one showing
segmental innervation and the other showing peripheral nerves.
