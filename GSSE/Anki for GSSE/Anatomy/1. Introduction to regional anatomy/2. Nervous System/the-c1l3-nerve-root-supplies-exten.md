<p id="3dd83cf2-17ec-4873-99d8-b193e6ab99d6" class="">This is an
indication of a single muscle or movement for which each segment
concerned is <em>mainly</em> responsible. An exhaustive list of
many muscles may be necessary for the neurological specialist, but
this information, on muscles that can be tested easily or are
otherwise clinically important, give a suitable indication of the
control exerted on different parts of the body by the various
levels of the spinal cord, and could be used for example as a guide
to the level of spinal cord injury.
