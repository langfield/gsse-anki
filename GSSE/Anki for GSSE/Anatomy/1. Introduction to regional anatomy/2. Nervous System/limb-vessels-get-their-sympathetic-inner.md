### Text
<div class="toggle">
  Limb vessels get their sympathetic innervation by nerve fibres
  that run with the adjacent {{c1::peripheral nerves}} before
  passing to the vessel.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="323a9c66-3a1c-40a4-aff2-ee0ded506401" class="">The fibres do
not run long distances along the vessels themselves.
<p id="d75f2d55-fc01-4bc3-9b8a-b39d0529f4a4" class="">Thus the
nerve filaments to the vessels of the tip of a finger or toe run
not with the digital arteries but with the digital nerves, and only
leave the nerves near the actual site of innervation.
<p id="794d3ed3-6d55-436a-a833-3300c2ff3f92" class="">In contrast
to those of the head and neck which receive branches from cervical
trunk ganglia.
