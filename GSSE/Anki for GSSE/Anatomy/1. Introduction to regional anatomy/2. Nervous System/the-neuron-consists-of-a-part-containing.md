### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  The neuron consists of a part containing the nucleus, the
  {{c1::cell body}}, and a variable number of processes commonly
  called {{c2::nerve fibres}}.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="6b36db76-2929-4753-a6d0-aeaed54d34c7" class="">In everyday
medical parlance, the word neuron is often used to mean the cell
body of the nerve cell, but it should be remembered that such use
is not strictly correct since the word properly means not only the
cell body but all its processes as well.
<p>(I assume Last's refers collectively to the dendrites and axon
as "nerve fibres")
