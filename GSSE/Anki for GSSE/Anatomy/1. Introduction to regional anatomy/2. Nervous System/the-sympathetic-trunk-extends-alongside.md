there is a ganglion for each spinal nerve, but fusion occurs,
especially in the cervical region where the upper four unite to
form the superior cervical ganglion, the fifth and sixth form the
middle cervical ganglion, and the seventh and eighth fuse as the
inferior cervical ganglion (and often with the first thoracic
ganglion as well to form the cervicothoracic or stellate ganglion).
