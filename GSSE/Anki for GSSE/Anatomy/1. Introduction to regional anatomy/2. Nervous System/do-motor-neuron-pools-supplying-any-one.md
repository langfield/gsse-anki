  Do motor neuron pools supplying any one muscle overlap with pools

### Extra
<p id="bbe73c91-3d0d-4221-94a2-73b07d33efcc" class="">e.g. the
anterior horn cells of spinal cord segments C5 and 6 that supply
deltoid are intermixed with cells of the same segments supplying
subscapularis and other muscles. The only exceptions to the
overlapping of neuronal pools are the brainstem nuclei of the
fourth and sixth cranial nerves, since they are the only motor
nerve cell groups supplying only one muscle (superior oblique and
lateral rectus of the eye respectively).
