<div class="toggle">
  {{c1::Connective tissue::what kind of tissue?}} binds the
  individual fibres of spinal nerves together to form the single
  nerve.

### Extra
<p id="a94156a4-a2c4-4ac4-b030-32c031ecb512" class="">In the
largest nerve, the sciatic, only about 20% of the cross sectional
area is nerve, so 80% is connective tissue, but in smaller nerves
the amount of neural tissue is proportionally greater.
