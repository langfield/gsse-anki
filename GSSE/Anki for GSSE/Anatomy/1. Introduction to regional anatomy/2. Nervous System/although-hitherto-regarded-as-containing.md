### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  Although hitherto regarded as containing only efferent fibres, it
  is now known that the anterior root also contains a small number
  of {{c1::unmyelinated afferent pain}} fibres which have 'double
  back' from their cells of origin in the posterior root ganglion
  to enter the spinal cord by the anterior root instead of by the
  expected posterior root.
