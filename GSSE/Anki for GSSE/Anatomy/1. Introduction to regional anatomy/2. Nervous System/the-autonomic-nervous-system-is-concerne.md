### Text
<div class="toggle">
  The <strong>autonomic nervous system</strong> is concerned with
  the control of {{c1::cardiac muscle}}, {{c2::smooth muscle}} and
  {{c3::glands}} (involving afferent and efferent pathways).
</div>

### Extra
<p id="dfbef7d5-0663-45cd-bce1-9bd948fa24f4" class="">The term
autonomic nervous system, which can be applied collectively to all
autonomic components, i.e. those that control the internal
environment of the body, is a descriptive term of convenience and
must not be taken as implying something anatomically separate.
