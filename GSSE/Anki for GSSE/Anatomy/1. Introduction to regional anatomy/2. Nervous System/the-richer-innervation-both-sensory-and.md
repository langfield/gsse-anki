### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  The richer innervation, both sensory and motor, of the flexor
  compartment shows in the fact that the most {{c1::caudal}} root
  of a limb plexus is distributed entirely to the flexor
  compartment of the limb.

### Extra
<p id="d5a1ee08-69e8-4bf3-8c3e-5c954a3879b7" class="">This is T1 in
the brachial plexus (apart from a small area of skin innervated by
the posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm none of this segment
supplies the extensor compartment) and S3 in the sacral plexus - no
S3 enters the extensor compartment of the lower limb (peroneal
nerve). Note the composition of the two parts of the sciatic nerve:
Tibial division - L4, 5, S1, 2, 3 Peroneal division - L4, 5, S1, 2
