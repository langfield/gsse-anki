### Text
<div class="toggle">
  Regional arteries may supply nerves by a series of
  {{c1::longitudinal branches}} which anastomose freely within the
  {{c2::epineurium}}, so that nerves can be displaced widely from
  their beds without risk to their blood supply.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="eacbf2cc-baa8-47c6-8756-3e383d8eafa8" class="">The phrenic
nerve, finding no regional artery in its course through the
mediastinum, takes its own artery with it (the pericardiacophrenic
artery).
