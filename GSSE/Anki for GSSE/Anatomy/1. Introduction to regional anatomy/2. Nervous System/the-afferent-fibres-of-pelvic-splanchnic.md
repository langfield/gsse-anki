### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  The afferent fibres of pelvic splanchnic nerves have their cell
  bodies in the {{c1::posterior root}} ganglia of the {{c2::second
  to fourth}} sacral nerves and the central processes enter the
  cord by the {{c3::posterior nerve}} roots.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="b8ebe2b8-6cd2-4342-bf4c-59739a25fc88" class="">Some make
local synaptic connexions, e.g. for bladder reflexes, but others
are pain fibres from pelvic viscera, which often seem to use both
sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways for pain transmission,
e.g. bladder and rectum
