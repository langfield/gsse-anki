### Text
<div class="toggle">
  Parasympathetic afferent fibres that run with the
  glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves have their cell bodies in the
  {{c1::inferior ganglia}} of those nerves, and their central
  processes pass to the {{c2::nucleus tractus solitarius (solitary
  nucleus)}}.
</div>

### Extra
Auditor note: it's not clear what "parasympathetic afferents" means
here (?pain, etc.), however it's likely they run the same course as
the nerves to the baroreceptors as indicated in the diagrams by
Brainstorm below Components of glossopharyngeal n (CN IX):
