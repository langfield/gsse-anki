<p id="2e406e5b-b964-4305-9b31-7702075b2a77" class="">If the elbow
be flexed while the numbers 5, 6 are recited, and extended to the
numbers 7, 8, one only needs to perform this simple movement to the
numbers 5-6 and 7-8 a few times to learn that biceps, brachialis
and brachioradialis (the prime flexors of the elbow) are supplied
by C5, 6 and that triceps (the prime extensor of the elbow) is
supplied by C7, 8.
