### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  Each spinal nerve without exception, from C1 to the coccygeal,
  carries postganglionic (unmyelinated, grey) {{c1::sympathetic}}
  fibres which 'hitch-hike' along the nerves and accompany their
  branches.

### Extra
<p id="e95d0b83-290d-4aff-b8f9-6dcee9295b8e" class="">In this way
the sympathetic system innervates the whole body wall and all four
limbs. This is chiefly for the function of temperature regulation.
The visceral branches of the sympathetic system have a different
manner of distribution.
