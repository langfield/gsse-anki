<p id="73cefbb3-02e0-47a5-a097-4ccbcc7afe1e" class="">For a tissue
that seems so dense and hard perhaps one of its most surprising
features is its vascularity. The cells of hyaline cartilage, and
indeed of other connective tissues, obtain their nutrition by
diffusion through the surrounding intercellular substance, but the
cells of bone, lying in their calcified matrix through which
diffusion is impossible, have been deprived of this facility.
