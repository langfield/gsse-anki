### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  In a muscle whose fibres run oblique to the line of pull, the
  number of oblique fibres is {{c1::much greater}} than the number
  of longitudinal fibres required to fill the volume of a long
  belly muscle.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="4d923e5c-3dde-43bc-8c13-1d27fcd05914" class="">The greater
number of oblique fibres, though each fibre loses some efficiency,
results in an overall gain of power in the muscle as a whole.
<p id="851e5f73-c670-4231-a0da-69b195fe5682" class="">Such muscles
are found where great power and less range of movement are needed.
