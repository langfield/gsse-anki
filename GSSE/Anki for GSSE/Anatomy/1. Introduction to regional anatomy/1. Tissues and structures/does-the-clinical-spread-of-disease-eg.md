### Text
<div class="toggle">
  Does the clinical spread of disease (e.g. infection, neoplasm) by
  lymphatics necessarily follow strictly anatomical pathways?

### Extra
<p id="a2399664-2695-4451-9e65-c588dec839ed" class="">Lymph nodes
may be bypassed by the disease process. If lymphatics become
dilated by obstruction their valves may be separated and reversal
of lymph flow can then occur. Lymphatics communicate with veins
freely in many parts of the body; the termination of the thoracic
duct may be ligated with impunity, for the lymph finds its way
satisfactorily into more peripheral venous channels.
