### Text
<div class="toggle">
  Where flat muscles arise from flat bones, the bare area between
  the bone edge and curve muscle origin is invariably occupied by a
  {{c1::bursa}}, which are always of {{c2::large}} size.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="8cb7c9bc-3249-4cea-bcd8-2585461f1908" class="">Bursa may
communicate with the nearby joint (e.g. subscapularis, iliacus) in
which case infection of one cavity necessarily involves the other.
Some of these bursae remain separate from the nearby joint (e.g.
supraspinatus, usually infra spinatus, obturator internus). The
temporalis muscle is an exception to this rule, for its fibres
arise from the whole of the temporal fossa down to the
infratemporal crest, and there is no bursa beneath it.
