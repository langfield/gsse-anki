### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  {{c1::Sesamoid}} bones are usually associated with certain
  tendons where they glide over an adjacent bone.

### Extra
<p id="6cf9605d-2540-443a-ae60-bd6228a147be" class="">The only
constant examples are the patella, which is by far the largest, and
the one in each of the two tendons of flexor pollicis brevis in the
hand and the foot. Occasional sesamoids in the hand may be found in
any of the flexor tendons in front of the metacarpophalangeal
joints. In the foot they can occur as in the hand flexor tendons,
and other possible sites include the peroneus longus tendon over
the cuboid, the tibialis anterior tendon against the medial
cuneiform, the tibialis posterior tendon opposite the head of the
talus, in any of the tendons at the medial and lateral malleoli,
and one in the lateral head of gastrocnemius (where it is known as
the fabella, an example not associated with tendon).
