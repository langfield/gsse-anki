### Text
<div class="toggle">
  A given drop of lymph may go by one of several paths, depending
  on local and even distant {{c1::pressures}}, and it is only when
  it reaches a {{c2::definitive lymphatic vessel}} with its valves
  that its subsequent route becomes unalterable.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="315aa61f-d871-40b2-9218-180f381b3e95" class="">Thus accounts
and illustrations of lymphatic drainage vary in different textbooks
and atlases. The question, 'Which description is correct?' has no
answer, since all may be correct under different circumstances.
