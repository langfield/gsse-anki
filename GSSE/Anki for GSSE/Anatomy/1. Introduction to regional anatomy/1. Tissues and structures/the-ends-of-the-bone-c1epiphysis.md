### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  The ends of the bone ({{c1::epiphysis}}) remain cartilaginous and
  only acquire ossification centres much later, usually {{c2::after
  birth}}.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="870bebbe-ce0b-4767-b61d-65cf102be9e6" class="">The dates of
commencement of ossification in epiphyses (secondary centres of
ossification) and of their fusion with the diaphysis were much
loved of the older anatomists (and examiners). Although students
are no longer required to memorize long lists of dates, which in
any case are rather variable, it is still important in radiographs
of the young and adolescent to be able to recognize the sites of
epiphyseal lines (where an epiphyseal plate of cartilage remains
between epiphysis and diaphysis) in order to distinguish them from
fracture lines.
