### Text
<div class="toggle">
  The periosteum is itself {{c1::osteogenic}}, its deeper cells
  differentiating into {{c2::osteoblasts}} when required, hence the
  deeper part is known as the {{c1::osteogenic}} layer.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="c3ee3d04-c3e7-4b85-b22b-d48301726fc6" class="">In the
growing individual new bone is laid down under the periosteum, and
even after growth has ceased the periosteum retains the power to
produce new bone when needed, e.g. in the repair of fractures.
