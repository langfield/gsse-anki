### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  Hair follicles on the scalp have a growing phase of {{c1::2-3
  years}} followed by a few {{c2::months}} in a resting phase,
  during which time the hair becomes detached from the base of the
  follicle and falls out before the matrix starts to make a new
  hair.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="0850293b-ac71-4440-8143-99191ed95c80" class="">Adjacent
follicles are out of phase with one another so that the constant
renewal and replacement are not obvious.
