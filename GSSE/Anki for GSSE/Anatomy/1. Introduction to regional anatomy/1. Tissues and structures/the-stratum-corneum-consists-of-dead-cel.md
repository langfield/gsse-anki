### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  The stratum corneum consists of dead cells ({{c1::keratin}}) that
  have lost their nuclei and are constantly being rubbed off and
  replaced by cells moving up from deeper layers.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="c3e6e7f2-a5ab-4b93-bb37-908349207ed8" class="">In the scalp,
scaly flakes of the horny layer may be trapped by hairs instead of
falling off visibly, so forming dandruff.
