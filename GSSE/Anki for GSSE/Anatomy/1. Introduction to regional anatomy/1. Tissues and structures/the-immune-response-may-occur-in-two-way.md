<p id="95495e06-1886-4b46-9574-cc3c127ce461" class="">(1) by the
humoral antibody response, with production of antibodies which are
protein molecules that circulate in the blood and attach themselves
to the foreign protein so that the combination of antigen and
antibody can be destroyed by phagocytosis; and (2) by the
cell-mediated immune response, with the production of specific
cells that circulate in the blood and destroy the antigen or
stimulate its phagocytosis.
