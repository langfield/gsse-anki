<div class='toggle'>
  Many of the cranial nerves are purely {{c1::motor}}, in which
  case proprioceptive impulses are conveyed by nearby mixed or
  sensory nerves.

### Extra
<p id="22c6baf6-13ad-460c-bd44-8d6d0b0bbd20" class="">The nerves
supplying the ocular and facial muscles (third, fourth, sixth and
seventh cranial nerves) contain no sensory fibres. Proprioceptive
impulses are conveyed from the muscles by local branches of the
trigeminal nerve. The spinal part of the accessory nerve and the
hypoglossal nerve likewise contains no sensory fibres.
Proprioceptive impulses are conveyed from sternocleidomastoid by C2
and 3 and from the trapezius by C3 and 4, and from the tongue
muscles probably by the lingual nerve (from the trigeminal).
