### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  <strong>Ligaments</strong> are usually of no avail in guarding
  against {{c1::continuous stress}}, since they are composed of
  white fibrous tissue (collagen) which, once stretched, tends to
  {{c2::remain elongated}}.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="a5ee3d13-9b92-4c00-bc39-005fa3d00612" class="">E.g. in
supporting the arches of the foot.
<p id="adf78013-bf43-40d1-80bb-48a4316b22c3" class="">This is well
seen in 'double-jointed' contortionists, in whom the restricting
ligaments are kept permanently elongated by practice.
