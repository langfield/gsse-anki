### Text
<div class="toggle">
  Synovial fluid has the extraordinary capacity of being able to
  vary its viscosity, becoming {{c1::thinner}} with rapid movement
  and {{c1::thicker}} with slow.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="24ac1654-9995-4e27-a866-96350686e73c" class="">However,
synovial joints should not be compared with machine bearings which
require hydrodynamic lubrication. Under slow-moving weight bearing,
hyaline cartilage on joint surfaces possesses an inherent
slipperiness greater than that of a skate on ice.
