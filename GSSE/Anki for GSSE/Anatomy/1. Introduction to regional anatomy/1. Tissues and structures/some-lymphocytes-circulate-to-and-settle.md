### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  Some lymphocytes circulate to and settle in the {{c1::thymus}}
  where they proliferate and develop into {{c2::T}} cells.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="73b561ff-dd37-4550-9485-770b97558f44" class="">The T cells
are so named because they depend on the Thymus for their
development; cell-mediated immunity thus depends on this organ.
