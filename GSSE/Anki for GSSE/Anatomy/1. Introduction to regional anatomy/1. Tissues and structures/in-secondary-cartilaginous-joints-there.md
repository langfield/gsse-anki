### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  In secondary cartilaginous joints, there is frequently a
  {{c1::cavity}} in the fibrocartilage, but it is never lined with
  {{c2::synovial membrane}} and it contains {{c3::tissue fluid
  only}}.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="25ad3f03-5715-477a-a543-69462905394c" class="">Examples are
the pubic symphysis and the joint of the sternal angle (between the
manubrium and the body of the sternum). An intervertebral disc is
part of a secondary cartilaginous joint, but here the cavity in the
fibrocartilage contains a gel.
