### Text
<div class="toggle">
  There are two varieties of <strong>{{c1::multipennate}}</strong>
  <strong>muscles</strong>: a series of bipennate masses lying side
  by side, and a cylindrical muscle within which a central tendon
  forms.

### Extra
<p id="af497896-564c-4989-8d3b-76dab30c6e35" class="">Examples of
the first type include the acromial fibres of the deltoid,
subscapularis, etc.
<p id="8f26861b-bea9-4276-a348-5ab4bbe54502" class="">An example of
the latter type is tibialis anterior.
<p id="692442b8-9473-4def-80c5-353faf451a5c" class="">A further
variety, unique, is provided by soleus. The main bulk of this
powerful muscle consists of short fibres that slope between two
aponeuroses, downwards from the deep to superficial.
