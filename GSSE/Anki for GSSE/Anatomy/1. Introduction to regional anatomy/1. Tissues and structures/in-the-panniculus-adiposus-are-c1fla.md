### Extra
<p id="a13fa5b6-51c7-4a07-bf5f-e88b241b8852" class="">The degree of
development varies widely in different animals. In domestic
quadrupeds such as sheep and horses the sheet is present over most
of the body wall. It can be seen on the carcass in a butcher's
shop, lying on the surface of the fat, generally incised in
parallel slits to make an attractive pattern. It can be seen when a
horse twitches the skin over its withers.
