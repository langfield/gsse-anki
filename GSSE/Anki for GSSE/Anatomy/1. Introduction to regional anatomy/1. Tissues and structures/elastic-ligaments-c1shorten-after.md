different picture in regards to joint stability.

ligamentum flava and the ligaments of the joints of the auditory
ossicles are composed of yellow elastic tissue, an important factor
in maintaining stability of the joints concerned. Yellow elastic
fibres compose the nuchal ligament of long-necked animals, but not
of man, whose skull is balanced on the vertical cervical spine and
whose nuchal ligament consists merely of a thin sheet of fibrous
tissue, a median intermuscular septum.
