### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  Large veins have '{{c1::dead space}}' around them, to allow for
  the great {{c2::dilatation}} that takes place during
  {{c3::increased blood flow}}.

### Extra
<p id="6c8085f8-e882-4704-8fef-e5012ca9ce37" class="">The axillary
vein lies in front of the prevertebral and axillary fasciae where
it has adequate room to expand, the femoral vein lies alongside the
femoral canal, into which it can readily expand. The internal
jugular vein has a loose part of the carotid sheath around it,
unlike the dense part over the carotid artery. The pulmonary veins
lie in the lower part of the lung root, where they can expand
between the two lax layers of the pulmonary ligament.
