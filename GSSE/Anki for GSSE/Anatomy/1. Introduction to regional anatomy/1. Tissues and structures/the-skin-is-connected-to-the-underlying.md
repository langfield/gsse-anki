<p id="c0c0f424-09a8-47fc-b18f-4914ddea18db" class="">This varies
widely in character in different species.
<p id="9d0f98cf-22d9-4a9c-a555-35ae564ef047" class="">In hairy
mammals it is loose and tenuous with a minumum of fat, so that it
is a simple matter of skin to animal.
<p id="96bfdc11-903c-4aa5-8348-25f285ce8388" class="">In others,
including man, fat is plentiful and fibrous bands in the fat tether
the skin to the deep fascia. Such an animal is more difficult to
skin.
