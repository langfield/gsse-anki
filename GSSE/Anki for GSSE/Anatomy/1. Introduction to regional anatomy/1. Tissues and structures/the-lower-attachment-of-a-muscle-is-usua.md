### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  The lower attachment of a muscle is usually the
  {{c1::insertion}}.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="978421c4-059c-4b19-8734-ce9bac68e3b9" class="">Which end of
the muscle remains fixed and which end moves depends on
circumstances and varies with most muscles.
<p id="7eafe93a-e312-4ff7-adfd-4f5dcc23749a" class="">There is no
reality in these terms. 'Attachment' seems the best alternative for
both origin and insertion.
