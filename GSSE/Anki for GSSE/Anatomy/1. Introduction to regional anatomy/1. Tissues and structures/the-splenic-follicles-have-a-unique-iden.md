### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  The splenic follicles have a unique identifying feature: an
  {{c1::arteriole}} courses through them, near but not through
  their {{c2::germinal}} centres.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="624703c3-4a48-4215-9384-1908f0d76915" class="">Of course, in
random histological sections not every follicle will be cut in a
plane that displays the arteriole, but when seen it is
pathognomonic of spleen, which also has a thick connective tissue
capsule with trabeculae extending inwards from it.
