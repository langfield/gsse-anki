### Text
<div class="toggle">
  In almost all joints {{c1::muscles}} are the most important, and
  in many an indispensable factor in maintaining {{c2::stability}}.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="b3dc40d7-ad08-4984-b12b-915a6a0cf0b6" class="">Such joints
as the knee and shoulder are very unstable without their muscles;
wasting of vastus medialis after synovial effusion, for example, is
followed by a feeling of insecurity in the knee in a matter of
hours. The short muscles of the scapula are indispensable as
fixators of the shoulder joint in all movements of the upper limb.
Muscles are essential to the maintenance of the arches of the foot.
There are many other examples.
