### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  If muscle fibres are {{c1::oblique}} to the line of pull,
  mobility is less but increased {{c2::force of pull}} of the
  muscle is correspondingly gained.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="660df7c7-6986-419a-ad11-5c8ed8217372" class="">Muscles whose
fibres lie oblique to the line of pull fall into several patterns:
Unipennate, Bipennate, Multipennate.
<p id="863f578d-8c93-45fa-9a47-a35e124186d9" class="">Such muscles
are found where great power and less range of movement are needed.
