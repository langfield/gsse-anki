  If muscle fibres are {{c1::parallel}} to the line of pull,
  {{c2::maximum}} range of mobility is assured.

### Extra
<p id="81b5b51d-c21b-4a09-923e-bc5f9453bf08" class="">A good
example of a muscle with parallel fibres is provided by the
sartorius. In flexing the knee and hip and laterally rotating the
hip, the muscle is contracted to its shortest length; rebersing the
movements elongates the muscle by 30%.
<p id="ea76c137-480b-46a7-ae65-2c6208d10a6b" class="">Other
examples of muscles with parallel fibres are the rectus abdominis,
the infrahyoid group, the extrinsic eye muscles, the anterior and
posterior fibres of the deltoid, the flank muscles of the abdomen,
and the intercostals.
