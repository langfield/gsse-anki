<div class="toggle">
  The limbs and body wall are wrapped in a membrane of
  {{c1::fibrous tissue}}, the <strong>{{c2::deep fascia}}</strong>.

<p id="e5e75b9d-4593-45d2-9a9e-f41d34954320" class="">It varies
widely in thickness. In the iliotibial tract of the fascia lata,
for example, it is very well developed, while over the rectus
sheath and external oblique aponeurosis of the abdominal wall it is
so thin as to be scarcely demonstrable and is usually considered to
be absent. In other parts such as the face and the ischioanal
fossa, it is entirely absent.
