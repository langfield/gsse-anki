than any other arrangement in the body. This is not surprising when
one thinks for a moment of the way in which the adult pattern is
reached. The embryo is little more than a bloody sponge, possessing
a vast and intricate network of anastomosing veins. Arteries are
sprouting, new vessels replacing the old, while the venous pattern
is reached by the disappearance of most of the network of veins in
the embryo. The wonder is that such uniformity of pattern is ever
attained.
