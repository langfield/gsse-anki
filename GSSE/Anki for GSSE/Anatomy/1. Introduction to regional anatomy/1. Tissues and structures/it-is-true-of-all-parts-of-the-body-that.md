### Text
<div class="toggle">
  It is true of all parts of the body that veins are {{c1::bigger}}
  than their corresponding arteries, for the simple hydrodynamic
  reason that the {{c2::rate of flow}} is much {{c1::slower}} in
  them.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="15ef2659-5b41-4374-bf32-44007d40ccc3" class="">For the same
reason they are often double, as the venae comitantes of peripheral
limb arteries.
<p id="15ef2659-5b41-4374-bf32-44007d40ccc3" class="">One can
reason about this through the Pouiseuille law as well - same blood
volume but at lower pressure â†’ need more luminal radius
