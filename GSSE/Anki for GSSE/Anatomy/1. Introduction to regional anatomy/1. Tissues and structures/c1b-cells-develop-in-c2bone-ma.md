<p id="20def9eb-41a8-4128-8f71-ed9eac95faae" class="">The B cells
were not named because they developed from bone marrow, although in
man this does happen to be a convenient aid to memory; the name is
from the Bursa of Fabricius in birds, for it was in chickens that
this organ (near the cloaca) was first found to be the source of
humoral antibodies. Although at one time the Peyer's patches of the
gut were thought to be the human equivalent of this bursa, bone
marrow is currently considered to be the likeliest source.
