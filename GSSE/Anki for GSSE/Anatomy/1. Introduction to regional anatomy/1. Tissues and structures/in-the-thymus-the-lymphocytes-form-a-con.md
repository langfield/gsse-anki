### Text
<div class="toggle">
  In the <strong>thymus</strong> the lymphocytes form a continuous
  dense {{c1::band}} of tissue at the outer region or cortex of the
  {{c2::lobules}} into which the organ is divided.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="2f0da524-a5b4-41a2-9c16-acee3558c9c2" class="">They are not
concentrated in rounded follicles as in lymphoid follicles.
<p id="a856d9e2-0b33-4287-a32b-059784646f47" class="">The
continuous cortex and the thymic corpuscles immediately identify a
typical thymus histologically (although in the ageing adult there
is usually much replacement by fibrofatty tissue).
