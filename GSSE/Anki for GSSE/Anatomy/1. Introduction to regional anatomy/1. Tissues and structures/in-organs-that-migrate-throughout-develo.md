  In organs that migrate throughout development, supplying vessels
  may either {{c1::elongate to reach the organ}} (as in the
  gonads), or {{c2::new vessels may appear to replace old ones}}
  (as in the kidney).

interesting feature of embryology is found in the fate of the
vessels supplying an organ that migrates far from the site of its
original appearance. The kidney is developed at the pelvic brim,
where it is supplied by the prolongation of the dorsal aorta known
as the median sacral artery. As the kidney 'climbs' up the
posterior abdominal wall it is supplied successively from the
internal iliac and common iliac arteries and then by a series of
branches from the abdominal aorta until the definitive adult
position is reached. One or more aortic branches may persist as
'abnormal' renal arteries.
