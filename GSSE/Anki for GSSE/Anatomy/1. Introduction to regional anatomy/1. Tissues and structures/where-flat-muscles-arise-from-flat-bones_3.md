### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  Where flat muscles arise from flat bones, the bursa occupying the
  bare area between the bone edge and curve muscle origin may
  communicate with {{c1::the nearby joint}}.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="79da8d72-37d2-4e2a-813a-c61fb8e80d73" class="">(e.g.
subscapularis, iliacus) in which case infection of one cavity
necessarily involves the other. Some of these bursae remain
separate from the nearby joint (e.g. supraspinatus, usually
infraspinatus, obturator internus). The temporalis muscle is an
exception to this rule, for its fibres arise from the whole of the
temporal fossa down to the infratemporal crest, and there is no
bursa beneath it.
