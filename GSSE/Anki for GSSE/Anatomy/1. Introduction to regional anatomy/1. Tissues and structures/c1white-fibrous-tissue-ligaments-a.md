### Text
<div class='toggle'>
  {{c1::White fibrous}} tissue ligaments are so arranged that they
  are never subjected to prolonged strain, with a couple
  exceptions.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="a23f9321-5533-4a5a-a917-6aa6009914a9" class="">The curious
exceptions are the sacroiliac ligaments and the intervertebral
discs, which are never free from the strain of the whole weight of
the body except in recumbency.
