### Text
<div class="toggle">
  Structurally, sweat glands resemble {{c1::coiled test-tubes}}
  that extend below the dermis into the subcutaneous tissue, with
  ducts that are reasonably straight as they pass through the
  {{c2::dermis}}, but which pursue a spiral, corkscrew-like course
  through the {{c3::epidermis}}.
