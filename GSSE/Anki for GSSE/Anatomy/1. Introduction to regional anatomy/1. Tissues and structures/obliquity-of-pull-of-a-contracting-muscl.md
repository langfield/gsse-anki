### Text
<div class="toggle">
  Obliquity of pull of a contracting muscle fibre involves a loss
  of mechanical {{c1::efficiency}}.
</div>

### Extra
<p id="f679aaec-e7cb-45f0-8efc-65215bcb09df" class="">But the
number of oblique fibres is much greater than the number of
longitudinal fibres required to fill the volume of a long muscle
belly. The greater number of oblique fibres, though each fibre
loses some efficiency, results in an overall gain of power in the
muscle as a whole.
<p id="b394ba68-77cb-4f27-a467-4bb26067e5f5" class="">Such muscles
are found where great power and less range of movement are needed.
