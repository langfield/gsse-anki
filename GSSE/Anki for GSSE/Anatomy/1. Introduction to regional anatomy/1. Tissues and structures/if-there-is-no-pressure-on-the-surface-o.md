  If there is no pressure on the surface of a muscle it is usually
  {{c1::fleshy}} in appearance.

<p id="3b976188-784d-4ce4-b652-5d005f4bf3d7" class="">Some muscles
are wholly fleshy, some largely aponeurotic, while many have a
quite characteristic mixture of the two.
<p id="63ed8147-7f66-4bfc-b44c-32bd58638c82" class="">The advantage
of knowing the surface characteristics of muscles should be obvious
to both physician and surgeon. For the physician, for example, the
diagnosis of 'rheumatic' pain or tenderness will often hinge on
whether the site is over aponeurosis or flesh, for where there is
an aponeurosis there is a bursa. Such bursae are often very
extensive and are usually open at one end, so that effused fluid
never distends them, but a 'dry' inflammation comparable to 'dry'
pleurisy will produce pain on movement and tenderness on pressure
over these aponeuroses. The surgeon sees muscles far more often
than bones, and instant recognition of a muscle by its surface
appearance gives great confidence and accuracy at operation.
