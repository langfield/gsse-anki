### Text
The four slips of levator scapulae fuse into the long belly, which usually is longitudinally split. It courses downwards to be inserted into the {{c1::upper angle}} of the scapula.

### Extra
It may not be derived from the upper limb myotomes, but from the
external of the three layers of the body wall.
