  The trapezius muscle origin extends from the medial third of the
  {{c2::superior nuchal}} line on the skull to the spine of
  {{c5::C7}} vertebra. It is attached to the {{c3::ligamentum
  nuchae}} between the external occipital protuberance and the
  vertebral spine. Below this the origin extends along the spinous
  processes and supraspinous ligaments of {{c4::all 12}} thoracic
  vertebrae.
