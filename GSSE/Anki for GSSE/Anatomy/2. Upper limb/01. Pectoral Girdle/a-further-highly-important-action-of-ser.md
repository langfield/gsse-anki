### Text
A further highly important action of serratus anterior is that of the lower four digitations, which powerfully assist trapezius in rotating the scapula {{c2::laterally}} and {{c2::upwards}} in raising the arm above the level of the shoulder. In this action it is a more powerful rotator than trapezius. In all positions the muscle keeps the {{c1::vertebral border (i.e. medial border)}} of the scapula in firm apposition with the chest wall.
