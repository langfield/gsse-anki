### Text
<div>
  The insertion of rhomboid major into the scapula extends from the
  {{c1::inferior}} angle to the upper part of the triangular area
  at the base of the {{c2::scapular}} spine; a fibrous arch
  receives the fibres of the muscle between these two points.
</div>

### Extra
<i>The fibrous arch is often only <b>loosely attached</b> to the
vertebral border of the scapula except at its ends (like the bony
origin of levator ani)</i>
