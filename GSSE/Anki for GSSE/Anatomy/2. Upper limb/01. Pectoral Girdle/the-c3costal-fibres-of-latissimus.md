### Text
<div>
  The {{c3::costal}} fibres (of latissimus dorsi) of origin can
  assist in {{c1::deep inspiration}}, elevating the {{c1::lower
  four ribs}} towards the fixed humerus. But the remainder of the
  muscle, sweeping from the vertebral column around the convexity
  of the posterolateral chest wall, compresses the {{c2::lower
  thorax}} and is an accessory muscle of {{c2::expiration}}.
</div>

### Extra
<i>These fibres sometimes become sore after prolonged attacks of
severe coughing.</i>

  <i>Latissimus is attached to the lowest 4 ribs.</i>
