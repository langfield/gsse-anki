### Text
<div>
  The branches of the long thoracic nerve from C5 and 6 join in the
  {{c1::scalenus medius}} muscle and emerge from its lateral border
  as a single trunk which enters the axilla by passing over the
  {{c2::first}} digitation of serratus anterior. The contribution
  from C7 also passes over the {{c2::first}} digitation of serratus
  anterior and joins the former nerve on the {{c3::medial}} wall of
  the axilla (i.e. on the surface of serratus anterior) to form the
  nerve to serratus anterior.
</div>

### Extra
<i>The nerve lies behind the midaxillary line (i.e. behind the
lateral branches of the intercostal arteries) on the surface of the
muscle, deep to the fascia, and is thus protected in operations on
the axilla.</i>
