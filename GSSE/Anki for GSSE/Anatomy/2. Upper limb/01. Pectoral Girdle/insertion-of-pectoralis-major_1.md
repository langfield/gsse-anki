### Original
<b>Sternocostal head</b>
<div>
  The <u>manubrial</u> fibres are inserted by tendon into the
  lateral lip of the [[oc1::intertubercular]] groove [[oc2::deep to
  (behind)]] the clavicular fibres as far down as the upper part of
  the [[oc3::deltoid]] tuberosity. They form the
  [[oc4::intermediate]] lamina of the insertion.
</div>
<div>
  The <u>sternocostal</u> fibres course upwards and laterally to be
  inserted progressively higher into the [[oc5::posterior]] lamina
  of the tendon, producing the [[oc6::rounded]] appearance of the
  anterior axillary fold. The fibres which arise lowest of all are
  thus inserted [[oc7::<u>highest</u>]] of all in the posterior
  leaf of the tendon. The uppermost limit of the insertion of the
  posterior leaf is, by a crescentic fold, into the
  [[oc8::capsule]] of the shoulder joint.
</div>
