### Text
<div>
  The costoclavicular ligament is in two laminae (usually separated
  by a bursa), which are attached to the {{c1::anterior}} and
  {{c1::posterior}} lips of the ligamentous impression on the
  clavicle. The fibres of the anterior lamina run {{c2::upwards and
  laterally}}, and those of the posterior lamina {{c3::upwards and
  medially}}.
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  <i>The ligament is very strong and is the major stabilizing
  factor of the sternoclavicular joint</i>
