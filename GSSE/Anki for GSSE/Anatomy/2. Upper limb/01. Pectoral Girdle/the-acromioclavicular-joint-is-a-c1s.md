### Text
The acromioclavicular joint is a {{c1::synovial}} joint between the overhanging lateral end of the clavicle and the underhanging medial border of the acromion. The articulating surfaces are covered (like those of the sternoclavicular joint) by {{c2::fibrocartilage}} (so it is an {{c2::atypical}} synovial joint).
