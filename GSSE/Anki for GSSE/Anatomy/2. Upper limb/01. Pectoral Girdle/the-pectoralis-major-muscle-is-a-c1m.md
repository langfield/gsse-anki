### Text
The pectoralis major muscle is a {{c1::medial}} rotator of the arm
and, in combination with latissimus dorsi, a powerful
{{c2::adductor}} of the arm.
<div>
  The sternocostal fibres are the chief {{c3::adductors}}; the
  clavicular head assists in {{c3::flexion}} at the shoulder joint.
</div>

### Extra
It is especially well developed in climbing and flying animals.
<div>
  With the upper limb fixed in abduction the muscle is a useful
  accessory muscle of inspiration, drawing the ribs upwards towards
  the humerus.
</div>
