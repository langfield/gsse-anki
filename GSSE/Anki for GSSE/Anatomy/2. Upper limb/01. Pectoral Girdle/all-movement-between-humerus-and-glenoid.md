### Text
All movement between humerus and glenoid cavity, except very slight movement, is accompanied by an appropriate movement of the {{c1::scapula}} itself.

### Extra
Generally speaking the shoulder joint, the acromioclavicular and sternoclavicular joints all move together in harmony, providing a kind of 'thoracohumeral articulation'.
