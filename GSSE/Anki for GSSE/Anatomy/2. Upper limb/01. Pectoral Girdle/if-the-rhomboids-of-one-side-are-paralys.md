### Text
If the rhomboids of one side are paralysed the scapula of the affected side remains {{c1::farther}} from the midline than that of the normal side.

### Extra
The rhomboids are tested with the hand on the hip or behind the back - the patient pushes the elbow backwards against resistance and braces the shoulder back. The muscles are palpated at the vertebral border of the scapula; being deep to trapezius they are not always visible.
