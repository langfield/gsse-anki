### Text
<div>
  From the costocoracoid ligament, the clavipectoral fascia
  stretches as a loosely felted membrane to the upper border of
  {{c1::pectoralis minor}}, which muscle is enclosed by the
  splitting of the membrane into {{c2::anterior and posterior}}
  leaves. They rejoin below pectoralis minor to extend downwards as
  {{c3::the suspensory ligament of the axilla::ligament}}.
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  The leaves are very thin and amount to little more than the
  epimysium of the muscle
