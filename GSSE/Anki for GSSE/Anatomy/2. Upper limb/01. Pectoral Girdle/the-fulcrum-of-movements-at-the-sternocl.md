### Text
<div>
  The fulcrum of movements at the sternoclavicular joint is not the
  sternal end of the clavicle, but the {{c1::costoclavicular}}
  ligament. As the lateral end of the clavicle moves, its medial
  end moves in the opposite direction.
</div>
<div>
  <div>
    Upward movement of the sternal end is halted by the
    {{c2::interclavicular}} ligament, and especially by the
    {{c3::intra-articular disc}}.
  </div>
</div>

### Extra
<i>Only in complete elevation of the acromial end, as in full
abduction of the arm, when the medial end of the clavicle can be
depressed no further, is the sternoclavicular ligament put on full
stretch</i>
<div>
  <div>
    <i>The clavicle moves about the costoclavicular ligament like a
    see-saw in both the horizontal and the coronal planes. In
    shrugging the shoulder the clavicle moves on the disc; in
    protracting the scapula, the clavicle moves with the disc.</i>
