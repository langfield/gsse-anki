### Text
<div>
  The axis of scapular rotation passes through the {{c1::conoid
  ligament}} and the {{c3::acromioclavicular joint}}; the scapula
  swings to and fro like a pendulum below these two fixed points on
  the clavicle.
</div>
<div>
  The total range of scapular rotation on the chest wall is about
  {{c2::60°}}, but only {{c2::20°}} of this occurs between the
  scapula and the clavicle.
</div>

### Extra
<i>The coracoclavicular ligaments are then taut, and transmit the
rotating force to the clavicle, whose rotation then accounts for
the remainder of scapular rotation on the chest wall.</i>
<div>
  <i>In both movements at this joint the fulcrum around which the
  scapula swings is the <b><u>coracoclavicular
  ligament.</u></b></i>
