### Text
Muscles developed in the upper limb are supplied by branches from the {{c1::brachial}} plexus

### Extra
During their development some of these muscles migrate for considerable distances to gain attachment to the trunk; but they continue to be innervated from the brachial plexus. Motor supply, once established in the embryo, never changes thereafter. An example is latissimus dorsi which, notwithstanding its very wide attachment to the trunk, still retains its supply from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus.
