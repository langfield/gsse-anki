### Text
<div>
  Forces transmitted medially from the upper limb to the glenoid
  cavity are transmitted from scapula to clavicle by the
  {{c1::trapezoid}} ligament and from clavicle to first rib by the
  {{c2::costoclavicular}} ligament. Thus a fall on outstretched
  hand or elbow puts no strain on either end of the clavicle at the
  joints. If the clavicle fractures as a result, it always does so
  <b><u>between these ligaments</u></b>
