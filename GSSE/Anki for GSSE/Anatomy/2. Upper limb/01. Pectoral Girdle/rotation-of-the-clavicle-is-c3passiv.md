### Text
<div>
  Rotation of the clavicle is {{c3::passive}}; there are no rotator
  muscles. It is produced by rotation of the {{c1::scapula}} and
  transmitted to the clavicle through the {{c2::coracoclavicular}}
  ligaments
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  <i>Palpate the forward convexity of the clavicle. Flex the arm in
  the sagittal plane and continue upwards in this plane to full
  abduction above the head. Restore the arm and carry it back in
  the sagittal plane into full extension. The rotation of the
  clavicle can be easily felt — it amounts, in fact, to some
  40°</i>
