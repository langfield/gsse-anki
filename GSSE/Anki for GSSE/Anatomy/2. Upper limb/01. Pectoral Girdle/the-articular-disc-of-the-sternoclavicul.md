### Text
The articular disc of the sternoclavicular joint is firmly attached to the {{c1::medial}} end of the clavicle above and behind, and
to the {{c2::first costal cartilage}} below, as though to restrain the sternal
end of the clavicle from tilting {{c3::upwards}} and being displaced
{{c3::medially}} as the weight of the arm depresses the acromial end.
