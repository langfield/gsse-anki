### Text
<div>
  The stability of the sternoclavicular joint is maintained by the
  ligaments, most especially the {{c1::costoclavicular}} ligament.
  It takes all strain off the joint, transmitting stress from
  clavicle to {{c2::first costal cartilage}}. The latter is itself
  immovably fixed to the {{c3::manubrium}} by a {{c4::primary
  cartilaginous}} joint.
</div>

### Extra
<i>Dislocation is unusual; the clavicle breaks in preference.</i>
