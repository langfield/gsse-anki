### Text
The thoracodorsal nerve comes from high up {{c1::behind::in front
of/behind}} the subscapular artery, but as it descends to enter the
muscle it lies {{c1::in front of::in front of/behind}} the artery,
at this level now called the {{c2::thoracodorsal artery}}.
<div>
  It is thrown into prominence in the position of {{c4::lateral
  rotation}} and {{c5::abduction}} of the humerus and is thus in
  danger in operations on the {{c3::lower axilla}}.
</div>
