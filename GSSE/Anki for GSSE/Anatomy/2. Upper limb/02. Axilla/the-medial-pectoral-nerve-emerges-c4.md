### Text
<div>
  The medial pectoral nerve emerges {{c4::behind}} the axillary
  artery and enters the deep surface of {{c1::pectoralis minor}},
  giving a branch of supply before doing so. It perforates the
  muscle and enters the {{c2::pectoralis major}}, in which it ends
  by supplying the {{c3::lower costal}} fibres.
</div>

### Extra
