### Text
Pronator quadratus action is to {{c2::pronate}} the forearm and hold the lower ends of the {{c1::radius}} and {{c1::ulna}} together, especially when the hand is weight-bearing.

### Extra
As a pronator it is more powerful than pronator teres, since its fibres run transversely and not obliquely.
