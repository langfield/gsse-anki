### Original
<div>
  The axis of the forearm runs from the midpoint between the
  [[oc1::epicondyles]] of the humerus down to the midpoint between
  the [[oc2::styloid]] processes of the radius and ulna.
</div>
<div>
  In pronation the axis of the forearm crosses the ulna obliquely
  and lies [[oc3::parallel]] with the axis of pronation-supination;
  it is in line with the shaft of the [[oc4::humerus]] though the
  ulna has not moved.
</div>
<div>
  The carrying angle exists so that the forearm may be in line with
  the humerus in the working position, which is that of almost full
  [[oc5::pronation::pronation or supination]].
</div>

### Title
The axis of pronation-supination is fixed in relation to the ulna, but the axis of the forearm itself is not fixed in relation to the ulna.

### Remarks
The axis of the forearm is therefore constantly changing with the
position of the bones throughout the range of prona tion and
supination.
