### Text
Replacement of the distal tendon of palmaris longus by ligament ({{c1::palmar aponeurosis}}) is a further characteristic of degeneration (like coccygeus and the sacrospinous ligament).

### Extra
<div>
  It is supposed that the muscle once existed as a flexor of the
  proximal phalanges, with its tendons lying in the palm
  superficial to those of flexor digitorum superficialis, and
  splitting around them to be attached to the proximal phalanges.
