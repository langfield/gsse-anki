### Text
The flexor carpi ulnaris nerve supply is by the {{c1::ulnar}} nerve through two to four branches.

### Extra
In 95% of cases the fibres have come from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus, or rarely from the middle trunk by a communication in the axilla; this is the contribution from C7 (the rest of the ulnar nerve being derived from C8, T1).
