### Text
[Flexor digitorum superficialis] From the humeroulnar head, a {{c1::fibrous arch}} continues the origin across to the radius, where the muscle arises from the whole length of the {{c2::anterior oblique line}} (radial origin).

### Extra
<div>
  The fleshy belly is partly hidden above by the other superficial
  flexors, and is therefore frequently described as being in an
  intermediate layer.
