The flesh which gives rise to the tendons for the {{c1::middle and ring}} fingers is superficial across the wide origin of the muscle, whereas the tendons of the {{c1::index and little}} fingers arises more deeply from the common flexor origin and ulnar collateral (medial) ligament of the elbow.

### Extra
<div>The tendons pass in the above order beneath the flexor
retinaculum, i.e. those to the middle and ring fingers superficial
to those to the index and little finger <img src=
