### Original
The axis of pronation-supination is oblique along the supinated forearm — it joins the centre of the [[oc1::head]] of the radius and the base of the [[oc2::styloid process]] of the ulna, and when prolonged passes near the little finger. It lies in the line of the shaft of the [[oc3::humerus]], hence the [[oc4::carrying]] angle of the elbow.
