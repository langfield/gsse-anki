### Original
Flexor pollicis longus arises from the anterior surface of the radius below the [[oc1::anterior]] oblique line and above the insertion of [[oc2::pronator quadratus]], and from an adjoining strip of [[oc3::interosseous]] membrane.
Some fibres, arising in common with [[oc4::flexor digitorum superficialis]], join the muscle from either the medial or the lateral border (or both) of the [[oc5::coronoid]] process of the ulna (the ulnar origin).
