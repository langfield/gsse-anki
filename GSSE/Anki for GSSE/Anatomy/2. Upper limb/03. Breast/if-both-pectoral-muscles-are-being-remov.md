### Text
<div>
  If both pectoral muscles are being removed during mastectomy, the
  {{c1::pectoral nerves}} can also be cut, but if pectoralis major
  remains the {{c2::lateral pectoral nerve}} must be preserved so
  that at least part of the muscle retains a nerve supply.
</div>

### Extra
The medial pectoral nerve passes through pectoralis minor.
