### Text
<div>
  Behind the breast the superficial fascia (the upward continuation
  of the membranous layer of superficial abdominal fascia of
  {{c1::Scarpa}}) is condensed to form a {{c3::posterior capsule}}.
  Strands of fibrous tissue (forming the {{c2::suspensory ligaments
  of Cooper}}) connect the {{c4::dermis of the overlying skin}} to
  this fascia, and help to maintain the protuberance of the young
  breast
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  <i>With the atrophy of age they allow the breast to become
  pendulous, and when contracted by carcinoma they cause pitting of
  the skin.</i>
