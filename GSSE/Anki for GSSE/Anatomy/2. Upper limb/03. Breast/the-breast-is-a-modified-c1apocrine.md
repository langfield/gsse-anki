### Text
<div>
  The breast is a modified {{c1::apocrine sweat}} gland and begins
  to develop as early as the fourth week as a downgrowth from a
  thickened mammary ridge (milk line) of ectoderm along a line from
  the {{c2::axilla}} to the {{c2::inguinal region}}. Supernumerary
  nipples or even glands proper may form at lower levels on this
  line.
