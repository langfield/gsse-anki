### Text
<div>
  Between the {{c3:: posterior capsule}} and the {{c4::fascia over
  pectoralis major}} is the {{c1::retro-mammary}} space, traversed
  by {{c2::lymph}} vessels and some blood vessels but relatively
  avascular.
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  It is the space into which breast prostheses are usually
  inserted, and access to it is most commonly through an incision
  above and parallel to the submammary skin crease.
