### Text
<div>
  From numerous lymphatic capillaries in the breast substance and
  the overlying skin, lymph from the lateral part of the breast
  (upper and lower outer quadrants) drains to {{c1::axillary}} and
  {{c1::infraclavicular}} nodes, while from the medial part (upper
  and lower inner quadrants) it drains through the intercostal
  spaces into {{c2::internal thoracic (parasternal)}} nodes
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  <i>There can be lymph flow between the lateral and medial parts
  of the breast and vice versa, possibly aided by the pressure of
  clothing or the examiner's hand</i>
</div>
<div>
  <i>Other pathways become possible, especially when the more usual
  channels have become obstructed, and lymph may then pass to the
  opposite breast, to cervical nodes, to the peritoneal cavity and
  liver through the diaphragm or through the rectus sheath, or even
  to inguinal nodes via the anterior abdominal wall.</i>
