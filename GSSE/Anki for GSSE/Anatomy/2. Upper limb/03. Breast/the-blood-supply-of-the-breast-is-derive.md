### Text
<div>
  The blood supply of the breast is derived <b>mainly</b> from the
  {{c1::lateral thoracic artery}} by branches that curl around the
  border of {{c2::pectoralis major}} and by other branches that
  pierce the muscle.
</div>

### Extra
<i>The space superficial to pectoralis major is relatively
bloodless. The various vessels supply the breast form an
anastomosing network</i>
