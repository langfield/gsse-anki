### Text
<div>
  The extent of the base of the breast is fairly constant: from
  near the midline to near the {{c1::midaxillary}} line, and from
  the {{c2::second}} to the {{c2::sixth}} ribs. It overlies
  {{c4::pectoralis major::muscle}}, overlapping on to
  {{c3::serratus anterior::muscle}} and to a small part of the
  rectus sheath and external oblique muscle
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  <i>A small part of the upper outer quadrant may extend laterally
  to form the axillary tail (but not always present)</i>
