There are three facets on the greater tuberosity for attachment of the scapular muscles: superiorly is the facet for {{c1::supraspinatus}}. Behind this lies a smooth facet for {{c1::infraspinatus}}, while posteriorly the lowest facet receives {{c1::teres minor}} whose tendon is inserted also into the shaft below the facet.
