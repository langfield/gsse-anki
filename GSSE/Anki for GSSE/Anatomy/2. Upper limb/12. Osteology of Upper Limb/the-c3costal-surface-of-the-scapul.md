### Text
<div>
  The {{c3::costal}} surface of the scapula is concave, and marked
  by three or four ridges that converge from the {{c1::medial}}
  border towards the {{c1::lateral}} angle. These give attachment
  to fibrous septa from which the multipennate fibres of
  {{c2::subscapularis}} arise.
