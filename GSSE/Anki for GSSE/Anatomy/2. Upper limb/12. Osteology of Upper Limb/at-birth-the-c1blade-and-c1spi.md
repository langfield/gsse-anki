### Text
At birth the {{c1::blade}} and {{c1::spine}} of scapula are ossified, but the acromion, coracoid process, medial border and inferior angle are still composed of {{c2::hyaline}} cartilage.

### Extra
<i>Secondary centres <span style="color: var(--field-fg); 
 background: var(--field-bg);">appear in these places, and around
the lower margin of the glenoid cavity, at about puberty, and all
are fused by 25 years.</span></i>
