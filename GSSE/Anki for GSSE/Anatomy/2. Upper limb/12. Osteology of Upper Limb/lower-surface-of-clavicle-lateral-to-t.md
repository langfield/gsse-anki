### Text
<div>
  [Lower surface of clavicle] Lateral to the sternoclavicular
  joint, which usually encroaches from the sternal end of the
  clavicle, there is an oval plateau (or a pit) for attachment of
  the {{c1::costoclavicular ligament}}. From here a groove for the
  {{c2::subclavius muscle}} extends as far as the {{c4::conoid
  tubercle}}. The lips of the groove give attachment to the
  {{c3::clavipectoral fascia}}
</div>

### Extra
<i>A nutrient foramen commonly extends laterally in this groove</i>
