### Text
The shaft of the humerus, the bone of the arm, expands above into
an upper end whose articular surface looks <span style="color: 
 var(--field-fg); background: var(--field-bg);">{{c1::up}} and
{{c1::back}}. The lower part of the shaft curves gently forwards to
a flat lower end projected into {{c2::medial and lateral}}
epicondyles, between which lies the articular surface of the elbow
joint</span>
