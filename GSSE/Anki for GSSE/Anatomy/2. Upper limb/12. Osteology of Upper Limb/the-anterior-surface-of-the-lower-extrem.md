### Text
<div>
  The anterior surface of the lower extremity shows a prominent
  ridge below the {{c1::pronator quadratus}} hollow. Between this
  ridge and the articular margin is a smooth area to which is
  attached the very strong anterior ligament of the wrist joint.
  The fibres of this ligament pass {{c2::transversely}} to the
  {{c2::medial}} side of the carpus.
