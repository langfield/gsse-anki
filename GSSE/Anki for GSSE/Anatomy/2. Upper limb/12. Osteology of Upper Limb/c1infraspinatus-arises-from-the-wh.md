### Text
{{c1::Infraspinatus}} arises from the whole of the {{c2::infraspinous}} fossa (but not from the {{c3::lateral}} angle).

### Extra
The large infraspinous fossa is concave on the under surface of the spine, and there is a groove alongside the lateral border, but between these two hollows the thin blade is convex in conformity with the concavity of the costal surface.
