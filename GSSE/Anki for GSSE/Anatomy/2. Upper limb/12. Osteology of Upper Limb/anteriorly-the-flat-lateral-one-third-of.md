### Text
<div>
  Anteriorly the flat lateral one-third of the clavicle gives
  origin to {{c1::deltoid}}, which muscle encroaches like trapezius
  somewhat on the upper surface, leaving a concave polished area
  limited by a low ridge. A {{c2::'deltoid'}} tubercle sometimes
  projects into the muscle near the medial limit of this origin.
