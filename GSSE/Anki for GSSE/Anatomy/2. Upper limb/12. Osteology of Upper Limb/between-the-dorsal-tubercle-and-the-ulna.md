  Between the dorsal tubercle and the ulnar notch is a broad
  groove. In the one compartment lie the {{c1::four tendons of
  extensor digitorum}} with the tendon of {{c1::extensor indicis}}
  beneath them on the bare bone. The tendon of {{c2::extensor
  digiti minimi}}, in its sheath, crosses the radioulnar joint in a
  separate compartment.
</div>

### Extra
<i>All five tendons share a common synovial sheath.</i>
