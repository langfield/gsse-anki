### Text
<div>
  The expanded lower end of the radius takes the full thrust (via
  the {{c1::thenar eminence}}) of a fall on the outstretched hand,
  and may lead to {{c1::Colles'}} fracture of the lower end.
</div>

### Extra
<i>The fibrocartilaginous disc of the distal radius forms a fulcrum
about which the characteristic deformities of the distal fragment
occur</i>
