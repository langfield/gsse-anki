### Text
<div>
  The medial margin of the costal surface of the scapula receives
  the insertion of {{c1::serratus anterior}}. The first two
  digitations are attached to a smooth, flat, elongated triangle
  from the {{c2::superior angle}} down to the {{c2::base of the
  scapular spine}}. The next two digitations are thinned out from
  this level down to the {{c3::inferior angle}}, while the last
  four digitations converge to a roughened area on the costal
  surface of the {{c4::inferior angle}}.
