### Text
<div>
  The upper surface of the clavicle receives the
  {{c1::interclavicular}} ligament alongside the sternocostal
  capsule attachment. The {{c2::clavicular head of
  sternocleidomastoid}} arises from a wide area on the medial
  one-third or more of this surface, but usually leaves no very
  apparent mark on the bone.
</div>

### Extra
<i>Two layers of cervical fascia surround sternocleidomastoid and
trapezius and are attached separately to the clavicle between these
muscles, at the base of the posterior triangle</i>
