before <span style="color: var(--field-fg); background: 
 var(--field-bg);">coming to lie in the radial groove. At the elbow
{{c2::brachioradialis}} and {{c2::extensor carpi radialis longus}}
are detached from the humerus and turned forwards to show the nerve
dividing into its superficial and deep (posterior</span>
<span style="color: var(--field-fg); background:
var(--field-bg);">interosseous) branches.</span>
