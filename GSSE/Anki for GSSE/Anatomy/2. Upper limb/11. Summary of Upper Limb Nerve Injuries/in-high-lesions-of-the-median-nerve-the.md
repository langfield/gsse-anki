### Text
In high lesions of the median nerve, the hand is held with the
{{c1::index finger straight}}, in the '<span style="color: 
 var(--field-fg); background: var(--field-bg);">{{c1::pointing
<span style="color: var(--field-fg); background:
var(--field-bg);">finger</span>}}' position, often with all other
fingers flexed, including the middle finger.</span>

### Extra
<i>Although the part of flexor digitorum profundus to the middle
finger tendon is expected to have a median supply (like the whole
of superficialis), its close connexion with the part supplied by
the ulnar nerve can lead to middle finger flexion. Furthermore,
this part of the muscle may be supplied by the ulnar nerve and not
the median.</i>
