### Text
<div>
  If all the roots of the brachial plexus are damaged the whole
  limb is immobile and anaesthetic, and {{c1::Horner's}} syndrome
  may be present. If serratus anterior and the rhomboids are still
  in action, the damage is distal to the root origins of the
  {{c2::dorsal scapular}} and {{c2::long thoracic nerves}}; if
  supraspinatus and infraspinatus escape, the damage is distal to
  the {{c3::upper trunk}}.
