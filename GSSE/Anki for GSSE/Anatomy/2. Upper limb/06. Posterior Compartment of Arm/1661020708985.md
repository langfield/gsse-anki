### Original
In order from above downwards, the radial nerve branches go to the [[oc1::long]], [[oc2::medial]], [[oc3::lateral]] and [[oc4::medial]] heads, and they arise [[oc5::before::before or after]] the radial nerve makes contact with the bone of the radial groove.

### Title


### Remarks
<div>
  Fractures of the middle of the shaft of the humerus, even though
  they may damage the radial nerve, are not likely to cause
  paralysis of triceps because of the high origin of the branches.
