### Text
The {{c1::musculocutaneous}} nerve passes through the {{c2::coracobrachialis}} muscle.

### Extra
<div>
  This is explained in terms of comparative anatomy. In some
  animals the muscle has three heads; in man two have fused,
  trapping the nerve between them, and the third part has become
  suppressed.
