### Text
Principally a {{c1::flexor}} of the elbow joint, the brachialis muscle, together with biceps, is used just as frequently as an {{c1::extensor}} of the elbow, 'paying out rope' against gravity.

### Extra
'It picks up the drink and puts down the empty glass.' Some fibres pull the capsule of the elbow joint upwards and prevent entrapment of the capsule between the humerus and ulna.
