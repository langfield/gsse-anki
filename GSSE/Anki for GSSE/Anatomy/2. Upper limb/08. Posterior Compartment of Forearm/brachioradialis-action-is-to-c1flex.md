### Text
Brachioradialis action is to {{c1::flex the elbow joint}}.

### Extra
It pulls on the radial styloid process, which is thus made the
leading point as the forearm flexes; the ulnar side of the forearm
passively follows, falling into the position of midpronation. This
is purely <b>passive</b>.
