### Text
Is the extensor retinaculum attached to the ulna? {{c1::No}}

### Extra
<div>
  Its upper border passes by the styloid process of the ulna.

<div>
  If the extensor retinaculum were attached to both bones of the
  forearm it would be over 30% longer in pronation than in
  supination. Such elongation is obviously not possible and, in
  fact, the retinaculum, attached to the radius and carpus and free
  from the ulna, maintains a constant tension throughout the whole
  range of pronation and supination, while the radius and carpus
  move together around the lower end of the ulna.
