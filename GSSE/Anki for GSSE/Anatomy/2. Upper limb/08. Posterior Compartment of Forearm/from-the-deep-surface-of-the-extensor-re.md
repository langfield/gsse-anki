  1. Abductor [[oc1::pollicis longus]] and extensor [[oc2::pollicis
  brevis]], each usually lying in a <b>separate</b> synovial sheath
</div>
<div>
  2. [[oc3::Extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis::2]] each
  lying in a <b>separate</b> synovial sheath
</div>
<div>
  3. [[oc4::Extensor pollicis longus]], which lies within its own
  compartment invested with a synovial sheath
</div>
<div>
  4. All four tendons of [[oc5::extensor digitorum]] lie, crowded
  together over the tendon of [[oc6::extensor indicis]]. All five
  tendons in this compartment are invested with a <b>common</b>
  synovial sheath
</div>

  5. The <b>double</b> tendon of [[oc7::extensor minimi digiti]] in
  a synovial sheath
</div>
<div>
  6. The tendon of [[oc8::extensor carpi ulnaris]] in its synovial
  sheath
</div>

### Title
From the deep surface of the extensor retinaculum fibrous septa pass to the bones of the forearm, dividing the extensor tunnel into six compartments.
