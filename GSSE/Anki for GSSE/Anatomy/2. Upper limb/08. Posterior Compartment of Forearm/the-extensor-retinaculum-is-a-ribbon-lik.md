### Text
The extensor retinaculum is a ribbon-like band, less than 2.5 cm wide, which lies {{c1::obliquely::horizontally/obliquely}} across the extensor surface of the wrist joint

### Extra
<div>If the extensor retinaculum were attached to both bones of the
forearm it would be over 30% longer in pronation than in
supination. Such elongation is obviously not possible and, in fact,
the retinaculum, attached to the radius and carpus and free from
the ulna, maintains a constant tension throughout the whole range
of pronation and supination, while the radius and carpus move
together around the lower end of the ulna.<img src=
