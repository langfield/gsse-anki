### Text
Extensor carpi ulnaris has an origin from the {{c1::common extensor tendon}}, as the muscle slopes downwards it is completed by an aponeurotic sheet of origin from the {{c2::subcutaneous border of the ulna}}.

### Extra
<div>
  This aponeurosis arises in common with that of flexor carpi
  ulnaris, the two passing in opposite directions into the extensor
  and flexor compartments.
