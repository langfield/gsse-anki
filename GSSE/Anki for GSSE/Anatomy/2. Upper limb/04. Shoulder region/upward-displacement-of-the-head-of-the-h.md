### Text
Upward displacement of the head of the humerus is prevented by the {{c1::overhanging coracoid and acromion processes}} and the {{c2::coracoacromial}} ligament that bridges them.

### Extra
<div>
  The whole constitutes the coracoacromial arch and, lubricated by
  the subacromial bursa, functions mechanically as an 'articular
  surface' of the shoulder joint. The arch is very strong. Upward
  thrust on the humerus will never fracture the arch; the clavicle
  or the humerus itself will fracture first.
