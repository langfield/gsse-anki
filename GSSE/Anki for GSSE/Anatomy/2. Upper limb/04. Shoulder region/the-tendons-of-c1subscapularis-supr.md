### Text
The tendons of {{c1::subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor}} (4) are not only attached very near the joint but actually in part fuse with the lateral part of the capsule.

### Extra

  This is an indispensable factor in adding stability to the joint.
  The fused mass of tendon and lateral part of capsule is known
  surgically as the 'rotator cuff.
