### Front
The supraspinatus muscle is of primary importance during which motion of the shoulder? (and why?)

### Back
It braces the head of the humerus to the glenoid cavity, to give
stability during the action of other muscles, especially the
deltoid, which it assists in <b>abduction</b> at the shoulder
joint.
