### Original
The superficial branch (C8) runs distally beneath [[oc1::palmaris
brevis]] muscle (which it supplies) and is distributed to the
[[oc2::ulnar one and a half]] fingers,
[[oc3::including::including/excluding]] their nail beds, by two
digital branches.
<div>
  The deep branch (C8, T1) passes deeply between [[oc4::abductor]]
  and [[oc4::flexor digiti]] minimi then between [[oc5::opponens]]
  and the fifth metacarpal. It supplies all three
  [[oc6::hypothenar]] muscles.
</div>
<div>
  Crossing the palm in the concavity of the deep palmar arch it
  supplies the two [[oc7::ulnar lumbricals]] and all the
  [[oc8::interossei]], both palmar and dorsal. It ends by supplying
  [[oc9::adductor]] pollicis.
</div>
