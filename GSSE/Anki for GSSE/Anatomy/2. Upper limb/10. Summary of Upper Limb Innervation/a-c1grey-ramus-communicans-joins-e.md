### Text
A {{c1::grey}} ramus communicans joins each root of the brachial plexus, and these sympathetic fibres hitch-hike through the plexus and its branches and remain in the nerves until {{c2::very near their area of supply}}.

### Extra
For example the grey fibres to an arteriole in a fingertip run in the digital nerves and not along the digital arteries.
