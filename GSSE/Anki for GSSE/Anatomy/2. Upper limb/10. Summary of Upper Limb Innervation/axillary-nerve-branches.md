### Original
The posterior branch supplies [[oc1::teres minor]] and winds around
the posterior border of [[oc2::deltoid]], supplying a small part of
the muscle.
<div>
  The [[oc3::upper lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm]] supplies
  skin over the lower half of deltoid, below the supraclavicular
  nerves.
</div>
<div>
  The anterior branch lies on the posterior surface of the
  [[oc4::humerus]] between teres minor and the lateral head of
  triceps and supplies [[oc5::deltoid]]. A few fine twigs pierce
  the deltoid to reach a small area of skin over the centre of the
  muscle.
</div>
