### Original
Although a three headed muscle, triceps is supplied by four radial
nerve branches. They arise as nerves to the [[oc1::long]],
[[oc2::medial]], [[oc3::lateral]] and [[oc4::medial]] heads,
usually in that order as the main nerve begins to wind round behind
humerus.
<div>
  The second branch to the medial head continues deep to triceps to
  supply [[oc5::anconeus]].
</div>
