### Text
Medial and lateral sides of the forearm are supplied by the {{c1::medial}} and {{c1::lateral cutaneous nerves of the forearm}} (from {{c2::medial cord of the brachial plexus}}) and {{c2::musculocutaneous}} nerves respectively.

### Extra
Each of these divides symmetrically into anterior and posterior branches, which extend down to the wrist, and the anterior branch may just reach the palm.
