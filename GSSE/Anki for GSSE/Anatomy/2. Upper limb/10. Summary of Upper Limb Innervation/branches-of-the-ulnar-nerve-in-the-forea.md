### Original
In the forearm the ulnar nerve supplies [[oc1::flexor carpi
ulnaris]] (C[[oc3::7]]) and the ulnar half (usually) of
[[oc2::flexor digitorum profundus]] (C8, T1).
<div>
  It has a [[oc4::palmar cutaneous]] branch (C8) which pierces the
  deep fascia above the flexor retinaculum to supply skin over the
  [[oc5::hypothenar muscles]].
</div>
<div>
  A [[oc6::dorsal cutaneous]] branch (C8) winds around the lower
  end of the ulna deep to the tendon of [[oc7::flexor carpi
  ulnaris]], crosses the triquetral bone, and is distributed to the
  dorsal skin of [[oc8::one and a half]] fingers and a
  corresponding area of the back of the hand.
</div>

### Title
Branches of the ulnar nerve in the forearm

### Remarks
<div>
  On the fingers it falls short of the nail beds. Not uncommonly it
  supplies two and a half instead of one and a half fingers.
