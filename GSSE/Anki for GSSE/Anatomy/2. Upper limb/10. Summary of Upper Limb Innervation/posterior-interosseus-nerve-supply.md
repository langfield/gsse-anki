### Original
In the extensor compartment it supplies seven more muscles;
<div>
  - three extensors from the common extensor origin
  ([[oc1::extensor digitorum, extensor digiti minimi, and extensor
  carpi ulnaris]])
</div>
<div>
  - three thumb muscles ([[oc2::abductor pollicis longus, extensor
  pollicis brevis and extensor pollicis longus]])
</div>
<div>
  - [[oc3::extensor indicis]]
</div>
<div>
  It is sensory to the [[oc4::interosseous]] membrane,
  [[oc5::periosteum]] of radius and ulna and the [[oc6::wrist and
  carpal]] joints on their extensor surfaces.
