### Original
It winds around the lower end of the radius deep to the tendon of
[[oc1::brachioradialis]], crosses [[oc2::abductor pollicis longus,
extensor pollicis brevis and extensor pollicis longus::3 muscles]]
(as one of the contents of the [[oc3::anatomical]] snuffbox) to
reach the back of the hand.
<div>
  Here it divides into two or three to supply the skin of the
  [[oc4::radial three and a half digits]] ([[oc5::falling short
  of::including/falling short of]] the nail beds) and a
  corresponding area of the dorsum.
</div>

### Title
Radial nerve in the hand

### Remarks
<div>
  These nerves and the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve commonly
  share the supply of 2.5: 2.5 digits rather than the ratio usually
  quoted
