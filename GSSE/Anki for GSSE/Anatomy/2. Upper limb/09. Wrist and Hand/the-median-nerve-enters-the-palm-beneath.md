### Original
The medial branch divides into two and supplies palmar skin, the
cleft and adjacent sides of [[oc1::ring]] and [[oc1::middle]]
fingers and the cleft and adjacent sides of [[oc2::middle]] and
[[oc2::index]] fingers. The latter branch supplies the second
[[oc3::lumbrical]] muscle.
<div>
  The lateral branch supplies palmar skin, the [[oc4::radial]] side
  of the index, the whole of the [[oc5::thumb]] and its web on the
  palmar surface and distal part of the dorsal surface. The branch
  to the index supplies the first [[oc6::lumbrical]].
</div>
<div>
  The highly important muscular (recurrent) branch curls upwards
  from around the distal border of the flexor retinaculum to supply
  the [[oc7::thenar muscles]].
</div>

### Title
The median nerve enters the palm beneath the flexor retinaculum and divides into three branches.
