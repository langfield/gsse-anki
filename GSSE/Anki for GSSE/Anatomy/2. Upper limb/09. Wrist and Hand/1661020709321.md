### Original
The deep branch of the ulnar nerve gives motor branches to the three [[oc1::hypothenar]] muscles, the two [[oc2::lumbricals]] on the [[oc3::ulnar]] side, all the [[oc4::interossei]] and both heads of [[oc5::adductor pollicis]].

### Title


### Remarks
<div>
  Compare the ulnar nerve in the hand with the lateral plantar in
  the foot. The cutaneous distribution is identical, but in the
  foot the superficial branch of the lateral plantar nerve, unlike
  that of the ulnar, supplies three muscles, and the deep branch
  supplies three instead of only two lumbricals.
