### Text
The sides of the midpalmar space are formed by the {{c1::septa}} dipping in from the borders of the {{c1::palmar aponeurosis}}.

### Extra
<div>
  Infection in the space can readily break into the connective
  tissue canals surrounding the <b>ulnar three lumbricals</b>, so
  that for practical purposes the space may be considered to be
  continuous distally with these lumbrical canals.
