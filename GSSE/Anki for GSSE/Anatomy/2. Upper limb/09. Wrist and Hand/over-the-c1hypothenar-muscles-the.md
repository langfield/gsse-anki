### Text
Over the {{c1::hypothenar}} muscles the deep fascia is much thinner than the palmar aponeurosis and it is thinnest of all over the {{c1::thenar}} muscles.

### Extra
This is in keeping with the increased mobility of the metacarpal bone of the thumb (note that the plantar aponeurosis over the big toe muscles is thick; the first metatarsal has very little freedom of movement).
