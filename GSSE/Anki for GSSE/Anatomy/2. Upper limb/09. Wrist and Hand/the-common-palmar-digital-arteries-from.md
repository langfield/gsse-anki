### Text
The common palmar digital arteries (from the {{c2::ulnar}} artery) run distally to the webs between the fingers where each vessel divides into {{c1::proper palmar digital}} arteries that supply adjacent fingers.

### Extra
<div>
  <b>The thumb side of the index finger and the thumb itself are
  not supplied from the superficial arch</b> since they receive
  branches from the radial artery.
