### Original
The action of the lumbricals is more obscure. Unlike the interossei, they are attached only to the [[oc1::extensor expansions]] and not to the [[oc2::proximal phalanges]].  Furthermore, their proximal attachments are not to bone but to [[oc3::tendons]], and are therefore mobile. The lumbricals thus provide muscular, and hence [[oc4::proprioceptive]], bridges between flexor and extensor muscles — a unique occurrence (as also in the foot) — which may have important implications in adjusting the positions of finger joints. It is almost certain that the lumbricals have the same action as the interossei, namely to [[oc5::flex the metacarpophalangeal joints]].
