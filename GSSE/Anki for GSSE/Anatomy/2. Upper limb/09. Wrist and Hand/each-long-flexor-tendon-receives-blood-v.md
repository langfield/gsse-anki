### Text
Each long flexor tendon receives blood vessels from the {{c1::palmar}} surface of the phalanges. The vessels are invested in synovial membrane. These vascular synovial folds are the {{c2::vincula}}, and each tendon possesses {{c3::two::number}}, the {{c3::short}} and {{c3::long}}.

### Extra
<div>
  The profundus tendon has its short vinculum in the angle close to
  its insertion. Its long vinculum passes from the tendon between
  the two halves of the superficialis tendon (proximal to the
  chiasma) to the palmar surface of the proximal phalanx.
</div>
<div>
  The superficialis tendon has a short vinculum near its attachment
  into the sides of the middle phalanx. The long vinculum of the
  superficialis tendon is double, each half of the tendon
  possessing a vinculum just distal to its first division, passing
  down to the palmar surface of the proximal phalanx. The short
  vincula, attached to the capsules of the interphalangeal joints,
  serve to pull these out of harm's way during flexion.
