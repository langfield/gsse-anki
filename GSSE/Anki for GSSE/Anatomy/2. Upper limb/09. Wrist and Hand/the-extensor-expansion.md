### Original
The bulk of the extensor tendon, however, passes freely across the MCP joint, and broadens out on the dorsal surface of the proximal phalanx. This flat part now divides into [[oc1::three]] slips; the central slip passes on to the base of the [[oc2::middle phalanx]]. The two [[oc3::lateral]] or marginal slips diverge around the central slip. Each receives a strong attachment from the tendons of the [[oc4::interosseous]] and [[oc4::lumbrical]] muscles, forming a broad [[oc5::dorsal digital or extensor expansion]]. The fused [[oc6::interosseous]] tendons and [[oc6::marginal]] slips of the expansion, passing distally across the middle phalanx, converge to be inserted together into the [[oc7::base of the distal phalanx]].
