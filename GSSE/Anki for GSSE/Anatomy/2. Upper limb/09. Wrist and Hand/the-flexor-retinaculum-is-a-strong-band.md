### Text
The flexor retinaculum is a strong band that is attached on the radial side to the {{c1::tubercle}} of the {{c2::scaphoid}} and {{c1::ridge}} of the {{c2::trapezium}} and on the ulnar side to the {{c3::pisiform}} and {{c3::hook of the hamate::specific}}

### Extra
<div>
  Note that these four bony points are all palpable in the living
  hand and that the pisiform is the only carpal bone to give
  attachments to both the flexor and extensor retinacula.
