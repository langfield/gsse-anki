### Text
Power grip depends mainly on the {{c1::long flexors}} of the fingers, with opposition of the thumb assisting the whole hand to give a tight grip. At the same time synergic contraction of {{c2::wrist extensors}} is indispensable for a firm grip of this kind; increasing {{c3::flexion}} of the wrist increasingly weakens this grip.
