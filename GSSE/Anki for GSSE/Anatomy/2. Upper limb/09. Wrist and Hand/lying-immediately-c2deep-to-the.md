Lying immediately {{c2::deep}} to the {{c3::superficial}} palmar arch are the {{c1::common palmar digital}} nerves

### Extra
<div>
  Note that on going from the palm to the fingers the digital
  arteries and nerves swap places: in the palm the arteries are
  superficial (anterior) to the nerves, but on the sides of the
  fingers the nerves are anterior to the arteries.
