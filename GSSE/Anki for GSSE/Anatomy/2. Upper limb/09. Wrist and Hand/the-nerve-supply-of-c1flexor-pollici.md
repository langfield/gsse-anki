### Text
The nerve supply of {{c1::flexor pollicis brevis}} is subject to more variation than that of any other muscle in the body. It may be from the {{c2::muscular branch}} of the median nerve or the {{c3::deep branch}} of the ulnar nerve, or it may have a double supply from both nerves.

### Extra
These possibilities must be kept in mind when testing for nerve injuries.
