### Text
Superficial palmar arch is formed by the direct continuation of the {{c1::ulnar}} artery beyond the flexor retinaculum.

### Extra
<div>
  It is badly named, for in two-thirds of hands it has a
  hockeystick shape and is not a complete arch.
</div>
<div>
  If it is complete it becomes continuous with the superficial
  palmar branch of the radial artery.
