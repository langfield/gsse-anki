### Text
Does carpal tunnel syndrome produce anaesthesia over the thenar eminence? {{c1::No}}

### Extra
There is no anaesthesia over the thenar eminence itself, for this area of skin is supplied by the palmar branch of the median nerve, or occasionally by the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm. Either of these nerves enters the palm superficial to the retinaculum, and so escapes compression.
