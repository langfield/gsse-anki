      <div>
        The cavity of the third ventricle is lined with
        {{c1::ependyma}}, continuous through the interventricular
        foramen with that lining the lateral ventricle and through
        the aqueduct with that lining the fourth ventricle.

### Extra
<div>
  <div>
    <div>As in all ventricles, the lining of ependyma reaches the
    surface pia mater to allow for invagination of a choroid
    plexus. In the third ventricle this place is the narrow roof.
