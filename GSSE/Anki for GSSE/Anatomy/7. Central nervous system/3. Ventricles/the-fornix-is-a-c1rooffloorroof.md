      The fornix is a {{c1::roof::floor/roof}} structure of the
      body of the lateral ventricle

### Extra
<div>If the corpus callosum is removed in a dissection the fornix
is seen lying upon the thalamus, with the choroid plexus projecting
between the two. It appears to be a floor structure of the body of
the lateral ventricle. None the less it is actually a roof
structure â€” a roof can collapse upon a floor and this has, so to
speak, happened to the fornix. <img src=
