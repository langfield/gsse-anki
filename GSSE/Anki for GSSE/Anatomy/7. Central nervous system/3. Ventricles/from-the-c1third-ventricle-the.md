        From the {{c1::third}} ventricle the {{c2::aqueduct}} opens
        below into the {{c1::fourth}} ventricle, which is a cavity
        in both pons and medulla.

### Extra
The plexus in the fourth ventricle is separate from that in the third and lateral ventricles and only makes a small contribution to the total amount of cerebrospinal fluid.
