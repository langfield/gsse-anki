        The cavity within the diencephalon is the {{c1::third}}
        ventricle, into which the lateral ventricles of the
        cerebral hemispheres open through the
        {{c2::interventricular foramina}}.

          The diencephalon, enclosing this cavity, has two side
          walls, a floor and a roof. The floor and roof converge
          towards each other posteriorly, where they join the
          midbrain; and the cavity of the third ventricle is
          continued through the midbrain as a narrow canal, the
          aqueduct (of Sylvius). The aqueduct leads through the
          midbrain into the cavity of the fourth ventricle.
