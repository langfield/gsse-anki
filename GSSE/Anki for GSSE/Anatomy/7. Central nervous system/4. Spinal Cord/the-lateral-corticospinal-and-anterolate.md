### Text
The lateral corticospinal and anterolateral tracts are laminated so the {{c2::sacral}} fibres are closest to the surface → interference with the anterior spinal blood supply will eliminate the function of all but the {{c2::sacral}} component of these tracts.

### Extra
<div>
  Recall that the pial arteries (supplying the periphery of the
  spinal cord) are given off by the surface anastomoses between the
  anterior/posterior spinal arteries and the radicular vessels.
</div>ASA/PSA - radicular a. → anastomotic connexions on cord
surface (deep to pia mater) i.e. pial arteries
