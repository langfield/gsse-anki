        Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is largely produced by the
        {{c1::choroid plexuses}} of the {{c2::third, lateral and
        fourth}} ventricles, but about 30% comes from other brain
        capillaries and seeps into the system by the extracellular
        fluid

        There is also some drainage through the cribriform plate of
        the ethmoid bone in the anterior cranial fossa into the
        tissues of the nose and so into the cervical lymphatics.
