### Text
<div>
  In the brainstem, most of the cells are aggregated into nuclei
  (collections of cell bodies). These <span style="font-weight:
  700;">nuclei</span> consist of three groups:
</div>
<div>
  (1) The nuclei of the {{c1::third to the twelfth}} cranial nerves
</div>
<div>
  (2) Other named nuclei which are demonstrable, such as the
  superior and inferior {{c2::colliculi}}, the red {{c2::nucleus}},
  the {{c2::substantia}} nigra, the pontine nuclei and the olivary
  nucleus.
</div>
<div>
  (3) The {{c3::reticular formation}}, a diffuse system of cells
  and fibres which is intermingled with the named nuclei and
  tracts, continues into the spinal cord.
</div>

### Extra
In the reticular formation, some of its cells form the so-called
'vital centres'- cardiac, respiratory, vasomotor, etc. -which are
not anatomically demonstrable as distinct 'nuclei', but are of
great physiological importance. Significant interruption of the
function of the reticular formation leads to brain death
