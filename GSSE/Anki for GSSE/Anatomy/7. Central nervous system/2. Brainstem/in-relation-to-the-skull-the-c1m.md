        In relation to the skull, the {{c1::midbrain}} extends from
        a level just above the {{c2::dorsum sellae}} of the
        sphenoid to a line that joins the apices of the
        {{c3::petrous}} parts of the temporal bones. i.e. most of
        it lies in the posterior cranial fossa, with its upper part
        passing through the {{c4::tentorial}} notch, and the front
        part of the cerebellum lying behind.
