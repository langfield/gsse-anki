        The {{c1::motor::motor/sensory}} nucleus of the trigeminal
        nerve is in the upper pons below the lateral part of the
        floor of the {{c3::fourth}} ventricle. The fibres pass
        ventrally and laterally to emerge as already noted as a
        small {{c1::motor}} <span style="font-style:
        italic;">root</span> at the junction of the pons and the
        middle cerebellar peduncle.
