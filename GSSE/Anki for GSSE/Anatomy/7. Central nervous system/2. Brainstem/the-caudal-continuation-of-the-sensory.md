      The caudal continuation of the sensory nucleus of the
      trigeminal nerve into the lower pons (and medulla) is the
      {{c1::spinal}} nucleus, which receives {{c2::pain and
      temperature::type of sensory}} fibres, while its upward
      continuation is largely a small bundle of fibres but with
      some cell bodies, the {{c3::mesencephalic}} tract of the
      trigeminal, leading to the {{c3::mesencephalic}} nucleus for
      {{c4::proprioception}}.
