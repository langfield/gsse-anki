        The secondary motor fibres pass through the corona radiata,
        and the corticonuclear fibres then run down through the
        {{c1::genu}} of the internal capsule into the brainstem.
        Some will go straight to the {{c2::oculomotor}} and
        {{c2::trochlear}} nuclei, and the others collect in the
        most medial part of the central three-fifths of the crus of
        the midbrain.
