        The choroid plexus commences at the {{c2::lateral}}
        aperture by a branch of the {{c1::posterior inferior
        cerebellar}} artery. Here it lies just below the
        {{c3::flocculus}} of the cerebellum.

### Extra
It indents the roof of the lateral recess, passes medially to meet
its fellow, and the two turn down towards the median aperture.
Together they form a T-shaped plexus, with the central stem being
double. <img src=
