        The anterior and lateral {{c1::reticulospinal}} tracts are
        descending tract that arise from the {{c2::medullary}} and
        {{c2::pontine}} parts of the reticular formation
        respectively.

        They are rather ill-defined in the brainstem, and their
        fibres become largely mixed with corticospinal fibres in
        the spinal cord. The Reticulospinal tract is responsible
        primarily for locomotion and postural control. The
        Reticulospinal tract is comprised of the medial (pontine)
        tract and the lateral (medullary) tract.
