        The dorsal feature in the upper pons is the almost
        rectangular but closed cavity of the {{c1::fourth}}
        <span style="font-style: italic;">ventricle;</span>
        sections of the lower pons, which contains the widest part
        or the floor of the {{c1::fourth ventricle}}, are usually
        presented as a broad band (without any ventricular root)
        with cut edges at each side (the transected {{c2::middle
        cerebellar peduncles}}).
