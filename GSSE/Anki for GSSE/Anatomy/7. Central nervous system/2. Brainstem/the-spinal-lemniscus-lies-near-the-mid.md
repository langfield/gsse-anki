      The spinal lemniscus lies near the middle of the
      {{c1::lateral}} part of the medulla, and runs up the
      brainstem at the {{c2::lateral}} and then the {{c2::dorsal}}
      edge of the medial lemniscus. It quickly becomes very much
      smaller, since most of its fibres end in the {{c3::reticular
      formation}} rather than continuing all the way to the
      {{c4::thalamus}}.
