  The muscle layers of the alimentary canal consist of an inner
  {{c1::circular}} and an outer {{c2::longitudinal}}.

### Extra
<div>
  <i><font color="#5FC9E0">In reality the muscle is in two spiral
  layers. The inner layer forms a closewound spiral and is known as
  the circular layer, while the outer layer spirals in such gradual
  fashion that its fibres are virtually longitudinal, the
  longitudinal layer.</font></i>
