### Text
<div>
  The liver develops as an outgrowth from the {{c1::foregut}} at
  its junction with the {{c1::midgut}}.
</div>

### Extra
<i><font color="#4FBCFF">A tube grows ventrally into the ventral
mesogastrium, bifurcates, and cells proliferate from the blind end
of the two divisions to form the two lobes of the liver, which are
thus enclosed between the two layers of the ventral
mesogastrium.</font></i>
