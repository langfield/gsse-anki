### Text
<div>
  After return of the physiological hernia, the two layers of the
  dorsal mesentry come into contact with the parietal peritoneum in
  the {{c1::right paravertebral gutter}}, so that three layers lie
  in the floor of the right infracolic compartment.
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  <i><font color="#4FBCFF">The deeper two fuse and are absorbed,
  the anterior (originally the right) layer remaining to floor in
  the right infracolic compartment, with the colic vessels lying
  immediately deep to it and in front of everything else on the
  posterior abdominal wall. The dorsal mesentery of the most distal
  part of the distal loop, pulled across transversely, does not
  fuse completely with the parietal peritoneum and persists, with
  the middle colic artery between its layers, as the transverse
  mesocolon</font></i>
