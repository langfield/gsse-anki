### Text
<div>
  The pancreas develops as two outgrowths, one into the
  {{c1::ventral}} and one into the {{c1::dorsal mesogastrium}}.
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  <i><font color="#4FBCFF">These two parts subsequently fuse and
  exchange ducts by anastomosis, but the double origin of the
  pancreas is imprinted on the adult by the persistence of two
  pancreatic ducts, the main and the accessory.</font></i>
</div>
