### Text
<div>
  When rolling the wall of the {{c1::jejunum}} between finger and
  thumb, it is {{c2::thick}} and {{c2::double}}, while the wall of
  the {{c1::ileum}} is thin and single
</div>

### Extra
<i><font color="#4FBCFF">In the jejunum the mucous membrane can be
felt through the muscle wall and feels like '<u><b>a shirt sleeve
felt through a coat sleeve</b></u>', in contrast to the ileum (the
mucous membrane cannot be felt as a separate layer)</font></i>
