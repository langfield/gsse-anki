### Text
<div>
  The convexity of the {{c1::greater curvature of the stomach}}
  lies in concavity of the transverse colon, the two being
  connected by the {{c2::gastrocolic omentum}}
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  <i><font color="#4FBCFF">Because of the fusion between the
  greater omentum and the transverse mesocolon and transverse
  colon, the greater omentum appears to hang down from its lower
  convexity, in front of the coils of small intestine.</font></i>
</div>
