### Text
<div>
  The ileal arteries form a {{c1::larger}} series of arcades
  compared to the jejunum â€” {{c2::three}} to {{c2::five}}
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  <i><font color="#4FBCFF">Most distal lying near the ileal wall so
  that the straight vessels branching off the arcades are shorter.
  There is more fat in this part of the mesentery, so the windows
  characteristic of the jejunal part are not seen</font></i>
</div>
