### Text
<div>
  The cremaster muscle can {{c1::elevate}} the testis towards or
  even into the {{c1::inguinal canal}}; although the fibres are
  {{c2::skeletal}} the action is {{c2::reflex}} rather than
  {{c2::voluntary}}.
</div>

### Extra
<i><font color="#1DE7E5">This cremasteric reflex is particularly
active in the infant and child and must be borne in mind when
examining the scrotum in the young, to avoid an erroneous diagnosis
of <b>undescended testis.</b></font></i>
