### Text
<div>
  If the rectus is split instead of being retracted in a paramedian
  incision, the split should not be more than {{c1::1 cm from the
  medial border}} in order to avoid the {{c2::intercostal nerves}}
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  <i><font color="#1DE7E5">The small part of the muscle medial to
  the split will be denervated and devascularized but this does not
  cause problems</font></i>
</div>
