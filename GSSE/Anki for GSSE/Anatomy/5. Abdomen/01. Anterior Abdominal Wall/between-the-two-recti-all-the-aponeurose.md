### Text
<div>
  Between the two recti all the aponeuroses fuse to form the
  {{c1::linea alba}}, a strong midline fibrous structure which is
  firmly attached to the {{c2::xiphoid process}} above and the
  {{c2::pubic symphysis}} below
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  <font color="#1DE7E5"><i>Above the symphysis it is very narrow,
  for here the two recti are in contact with one another behind it.
  From just below the umbilicus to the xiphisternum it broadens out
  between the recti.</i></font>
</div>
