### Text
The most lateral fibres of the internal oblique, those arising from
just below the anterior superior iliac spine, arch downwards to
reach the {{c1::pubic symphysis}}, in front of rectus abdominis.
<div>
  The remaining fibres arch concentrically, passing in front of
  rectus abdominis along the {{c2::pubic crest}} as far as the
  {{c2::pubic tubercle}} and then extending laterally along the
  {{c3::pectineal line}} as far as the crescentic edge of the
  lacunar ligament
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  <i><font color="#1DE7E5">These lateral fibres, joining the
  underlying transversus aponeurosis, constitute with them the
  <b>conjoint tendon.</b></font></i>
