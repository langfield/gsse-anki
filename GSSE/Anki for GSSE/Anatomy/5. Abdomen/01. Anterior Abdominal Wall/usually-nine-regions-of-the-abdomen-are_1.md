### Text
Usually nine regions of the abdomen are delineated by two vertical and two horizontal lines.

The lower transverse line is drawn between the {{c1::tubercles of the iliac crests (intertubercular plane)}} and the upper transverse line is in the {{c2::transpyloric plane}} midway between the {{c3::jugular notch}} and the {{c3::top of the pubic symphysis}}

### Extra
<i><font color="#1DE7E5">The transpyloric plane is vertebral level
T1 Some clinicians use the subcostal plane which is a little lower
â€” level with the lowest part of the costal margin (vertebral level
T2)</font></i>
