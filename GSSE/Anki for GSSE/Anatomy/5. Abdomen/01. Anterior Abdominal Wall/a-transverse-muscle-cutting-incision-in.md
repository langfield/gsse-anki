### Text
A transverse muscle cutting incision (instead of gridiron) can be made from {{c1::above and medial to the ASIS}} and extendering nearly to {{c2::the lateral border of rectus sheath}}

### Extra
<div>
  <i><font color="#4FBCFF">Transverse muscle-cutting incisions can
  be made above or below the umbilicus, cutting one or both rectus
  sheaths and muscles and extending laterally into the obliques and
  transversus, or just cutting the more lateral muscles.
  Intercostal nerves run obliquely through the lower abdominal
  wall, but more than one is not likely to be cut by these
  transverse incisions.</font></i>
