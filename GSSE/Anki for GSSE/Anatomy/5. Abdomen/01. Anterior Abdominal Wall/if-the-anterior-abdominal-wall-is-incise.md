### Text
<div>
  If the anterior abdominal wall is incised or removed, only the
  {{c1::intestines}} spill out.
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  <i><font color="#1DE7E5">At most the wall helps to support the
  intestines, suspended by their mesenteries; the upper abdominal
  viscera such as the liver, spleen and kidneys do not require the
  wall for this purpose, but reflex contraction in response to a
  blow helps to protect all viscera.</font></i>
</div>
