### Text
<div>
  Due to the obliquity of the superficial ring, the cord, which
  passes {{c1::vertically downwards}} after emerging therefrom,
  overlies the {{c2::pubic tubercle}}
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  <i><font color="#1DE7E5">For this reason the pubic tubercle is
  not readily palpable from in front, and for the satisfaction of
  the examiner and the comfort of the subject, should be palpated
  in the living by a finger that invaginates the scrotum <b>behind
  the cord</b></font></i>
</div>
