### Text
<div>
  Damage to the ilioinguinal nerve as it lies in the inguinal canal
  does not paralyse the muscle fibres that tighten the conjoint
  tendon because {{c1::at this level the nerve is purely sensory,
  having already given off its motor fibres.}}
</div>

### Extra
<i><font color="#1DE7E5">Injury here will only cause some sensory
loss over the anterior part of the scrotum (labium majus) and
adjacent thigh.</font></i>
