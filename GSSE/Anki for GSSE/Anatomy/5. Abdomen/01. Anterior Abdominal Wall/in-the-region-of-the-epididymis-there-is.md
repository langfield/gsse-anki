### Text
<div>
  In the region of the epididymis there is an anastomosis between
  the {{c1::testicular}}, {{c1::cremasteric}} and {{c1::ductal}}
  arteries.
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  <i><font color="#1DE7E5">If the main artery is divided, the
  smaller vessels may not completely sustain the testis; atrophy
  may occur, though ischaemic necrosis is unlikely</font></i>
</div>
