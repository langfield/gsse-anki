### Text
In which parts is the areolar tissue thick?

{{c1::Over non expansile parts of the abdomen - e.g. iliac fascia, psoas fascia, parietal pelvic fascia}}

### Extra
<div>
  <i><font color="#4FBCFF">Serve as firm bases upon which the
  extraperitoneal tissue can gain attachment. The posterior
  surfaces of retroperitoneal structures (pancreas, duodenum,
  ascending and descending colon) also gain a firm attachment to
  these fasciae. Thus peritoneum and viscera have a firm anchorage
  undisturbed by the movements of contraction of the underlying
  muscles.</font></i>
