### Text
<div>
  The {{c1::3rd and 4th}} lumbar splancnic nerves join with each
  other and with fibres from the {{c2::aortic plexus}} in front of
  {{c3::L5 vertebra}} to form the {{c4::superior hypogastric
  plexus}}
</div>

### Extra
<div>
  <i><font color="#4FBCFF">This was previously known as the
  <b><u>presacral nerve</u></b> but was a misnomer: it is
  prelumbar, not presacral, and is not a single nerve but a
  plexus</font></i>
</div>
