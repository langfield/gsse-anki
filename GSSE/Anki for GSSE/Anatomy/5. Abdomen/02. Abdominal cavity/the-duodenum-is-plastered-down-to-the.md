### Text
The duodenum is plastered down to the {{c1::posterior abdominal wall (i.e. is retroperitoneal)}}, while the whole length of small intestine {{c2::swings free on its own mesentery}}.

### Extra
Strictly speaking this statement from Last's is not 100% correct. The 2nd through 4th parts of the duodenum are retroperitoneal but the 1st is suspended by mesentery.
