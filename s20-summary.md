# Summary of [SuperMemo's 20 rules of formulating information](http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm)
Author: Kimiyasu "Mickey" Kondo

1. Do not learn if you do not understand
2. Learn before you memorise: build an overall picture before you make cards
3. Build upon the basics: do not neglect the seemingly easy things
4. Keep the cards simple: split information into small digestible chunks
5. Cloze deletions are easy and effective
6. Use visual stimuli to boost retention
7. Use mnemonic techniques when possible
8. Graphic deletion (image occlusion) is as good as cloze deletion
9. Avoid big sets and long lists: break them down into smaller groups if possible
10. Avoid enumerations (e.g. having a whole poem on one card: try using smaller overlapped cloze deletions.
11. Fight to distinguish similar pieces of information from one another and avoid confusion
12. Optimise wording so there are fewer words and bigger impact
13. Refer to other memories (perhaps those that you built in the deck earlier)
14. Personalise and give examples (to an extent because it is a public deck after all)
15. Use vivid and emotional examples (humour is particularly useful)
16. Give the context of the answer as a hint to simplify wording
17. Redundancy can sometimes be useful and does not break rule 4 e.g. multiple solutions to a problem, multiple explanations of a concept
18. Provide sources for your knowledge if possible and relevant (applies esp to anatomy, lots of contradicting information between different textbooks)
19. Date-stamp knowledge that can be relatively volatile (not as applicable to GSSE since Last's 9e has been in use for ages, but still applicable to e.g. anatomical variants, new scientific findings)
20. Prioritise knowledge that is high yield
