Here I will address common FAQs and hate comments that I hear/get about this project.

## What's the point of remaking another Anki deck if one already exists?

I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but the Anki decks that already exist for the GSSE are not the same kind of Anki decks that exist for the USMLE. At the very least, they suffer from the following major issues:

1. They are clearly geared towards practicing and remembering questions (!!!) rather than being a useful aid to personal learning and retention.
2. I will unreservedly say that the cards in the existing decks on the market are very poorly made and unenjoyable to use.

For more information, see the answer to “Why can’t we just copy Hyerim’s stuff?”. For an idea of the kind of Anki deck this project aims to produce, go have a look at [Zanki](ankipalace.com) (for USMLE Step 1) or [WiWa](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/97ssh3/wiwa_deck_for_step_ii_ck_reupload/) (for USMLE Step 2 CK). Or for that matter, just spend some time lurking around [r/medicalschoolanki](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/).

## Why can't we just copy Hyerim's stuff?/What's wrong with just practicing and remembering questions?

Some people have asked me what we're going to do with Hyerim's Anki Qbank (on her GDrive). The plan is currently to merge its content into the end product, but I personally think that "testing" (practice questions) and "learning" (cards, textbooks, notes, etc.) should be kept separate, as they would be when preparing for the USMLE.

That is to say, the points of the answers can be made into cards albeit Anki should not be used as a means to memorise questions themselves. Questions are for practicing and applying your knowledge and can be written in as ungodly complicated a manner as the examiner so prefers. However, it is of the utmost importance that cards be kept as simple as possible and stick to the [minimum information principle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Minimum_information_principle) to optimise retention.

Please also read through [Supermemo's 20 rules of formulating information](https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules) to better understand how this project intends to structure cards.

## Why do you think using Anki is a good idea for the GSSE?/Why bother with Anki?

The [body of evidence supporting spaced repetition's effectiveness](http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition) is quite strong, so it's not a question of whether Anki is a good way to study for the GSSE specifically. Instead, it is **unequivocally** the case that *spaced repetition software like Anki and SuperMemo is the best way to study for anything you intend to remember over the long term*.

It is possible to make the case that the level of retention that Anki produces is not necessary for a mere exam, given the level of effort input that many perceive it to require. But I would hope that aspiring surgeons are interested in remembering their anatomy forever if they can.
